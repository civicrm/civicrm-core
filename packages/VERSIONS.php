 * Introduction
 * ============
 *
 * The "packages" directory (aka civicrm-packages.git) is a collection of
 * third-party libraries required by CiviCRM.  Some of the libraries have are
 * downloaded and added by hand; other libraries are added using tools.  This
 * file provides all the notes about how/where to download/upgrade third-party
 * library.
 *
 * Note that the packages directory is generally deprecated for
 * managing dependencies. Instead, one should update a config file
 * in the main civicrm-core project:
 *
 *  - For PHP dependencies, use composer.json
 *  - For client-side CSS/JS resources, use bower.json
 *  - For CLI JS tools, use package.json

 * How-To: Manual upgrade of a forked package
 * ==========================================
 *
 * 1. download old version of upstream and overwrite packages with it (pear install Archive_Tar-1.3.3).
 *    If the version is not obvious, you may need to check a few different versions.
 * 2. if there are differences, it means we patched the package – do a *reverse* diff and save to a patch file (git diff -R > /tmp/Archive_Tar.diff)
 * 3. download current version and overwrite
 * 4. if there were differences, copy any files that we patched in the old version to packages.orig
 * 5. if there were differences, apply the patch from 2. (patch -p1 < /tmp/Archive_Tar.diff)
 * 6. update this file and commit
 *
 *
 * How-To: Migrate a package to composer
 * =====================================
 *
 * To improve maintainability, it is desirable to migrate PHP dependencies from `civicrm-packages.git`
 * to `civicrm-core.git:composer.json`. This is a somewhat painstaking process, but it makes future
 * upgrades easier.
 *
 * A. Assess situation
 *     1. Determine the old/active version of the package `Foo`.
 *     2. Download the old/active version of package `Foo`, overwriting the copy in `packages/Foo`
 *     3. Check for for differences. If there are some, it means we patched the package – do
 *        a *reverse* diff and save to a patch file (`git diff -R > /tmp/Archive_Tar.diff`)
 *     4. Determine if the patches are still relevent in newer releases of the package.
 *     5. Determine if changing the live path of the package will impact anything.
 *        In particular, look out for hard-coded references to `packages/Foo`. Ideally, check `universe`.
 *     6. Revert/undo any changes you made during assessment.
 * B. Prepare PRs
 *     1. For `civicrm-core.git`, prepare a branch with a few commits:
 *
 *        Update `composer.json` and `composer.lock`. Be careful to *only* update necessary packages
 *        and to use versions that work in Civi's minimum requirements (PHP/MySQL versions).
 *
 *        If your assessment found important patches, then use `composer.json` to re-apply
 *        those patches (e.g.`extra: patches: ...` or `post-install-cmd`).
 *
 *        Cleanup any hard-coded references to `packages/Foo`.
 *
 *     2. For `civicrm-packages.git`, prepare a branch. Remove the old code.
 *     3. Locally, test that the new combination works.
 *     4. Submit two PRs for `civicrm-core.git` and `civicrm-packages.git`. In the description
 *        or comments, provide cross-links. (Reviewers will need to be aware of both PRs so they
 *        can test appropriately.)
 * C. Review the PRs
 *     The reviewer will need to setup both patches and include them in a test-run.
 *     There is no fully automatic bot for this test scenario.
 *     One way to test this is with civibuild and civi-test-run:
 *        civibuild create mytest --type drupal-clean --patch <github-pr-url-1> --patch <github-pr-url-2> ...
 *        civi-test-run -b mytest -j /tmp/junit-output
