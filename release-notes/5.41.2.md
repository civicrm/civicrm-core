## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_Smart Groups_: Smart groups based on custom-searches are miscomputed. ([dev/core#2861](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2861): [#21601](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21601))**

  The smart group may be signficantly over-sized, including contacts who should not be members.

* **_APIv4_: Backport "File" API ([#21158](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21158))**

  This fixes a bug in which "Search Kit" displays crash if the target field references a file.
