## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: Recurring contribution scheduled incorrectly ([dev/core#2231](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2231): [#19119](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19119))**

  This is a runtime fix that prevents further miscalculation. Sites which used a buggy version may also need to fix miscalculated schedules. Please visit [dev/core#2231](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2231) for discussion of techniques or future updates.

* **_Advanced Search_: Error handling custom-fields of type "Integer" / "Radio" ([dev/core#2188](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2188): [#18970](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18970), [#19123](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19123))**
* **_Export_: Error exporting non-primary fields ([dev/core#2230](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2230): [#19104](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19104))**
