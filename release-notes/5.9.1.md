## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

- **[dev/core#660](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/660) Fatal DB Error:
  already exists on event registration/contribution pages when profile has user
  creation ([Backport
  13451](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13451))**

  In CiviContribute and CiviEvent, this fixes a crash on the payment page
  affecting anonymous users in certain ACL configurations.  The change relaxes a
  foreign-key constraint.

- **Fix broken case activity date filter #13449
  ([Backport 13449](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13449))**
