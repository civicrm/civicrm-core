## <a name="features"></a>Features removed

* **_CiviEvent_: Revert timezone changes ([dev/core#2122](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2122): [#22940](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22940), [#22930](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22930))**

    v5.47.0 added timezone support to CiviEvent. Due to open issues which can affect downstream integrations and the accuracy of times, it is being removed from 5.47.3.

    The schema and API for CiviEvent will now match v5.46.

    If you use CiviEvent and ran v5.47.0-v5.47.2, please read the [CiviEvent v5.47 Timezone Notice](https://civicrm.org/redirect/event-timezone-5.47).
