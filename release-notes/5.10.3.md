### Core CiviCRM

- **[dev/core#695](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/695) Custom Search
  results selection failure and
  [dev/core#679](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/679) Groups and Tags
  affect search results when using Search Builder
  ([13533](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13533))**

  This resolves some search regressions introduced in 5.9.0 relating to caching
  and custom searches.

- **[dev/core#737](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/737) SMS not sent if
  "Send Immediately" option is chosen on the last screen
  ([13641](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13641))**

  This resolves an issue where if you selected to send a Bulk SMS immediately
  it would not be sent because the scheduled date was set to `NULL` rather than
  the current date and time.
