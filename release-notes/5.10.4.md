## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

- **([dev/core#747](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/747)) Contact images
  can no longer be viewed or re-uploaded
  ([13679](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13679))**

  Following the security release, loading of images on the contact summary
  screen broke due to the removal of handling of the filename url parameter

- **([dev/report#10](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/10)) No
  pagination on Contribution Detail report
  ([13677](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13677))**

  Fixed a recent regression where the pagination on the Contribution Detail
  report broke.

- **([dev/core#746](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/746)) Search Builder
  searches using > 1 smart group where operator is equals is broken from 5.10.0
  ([13667](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13667))**

  This fixes a recent regression whereby if you had more than one `WHERE`
  clause involving groups, and the groups were smart groups, it wouldn't return
  the correct results.
