## <a name="features"></a>Features

### Core CiviCRM

- **Add civicrm_admin_ui extension
  ([22628](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22628))**

  Adds a new bundled extension `civicrm_admin_ui`. This extension replaces 2
  screens with SearchDisplay Afforms: Custom field groups and Custom fields.

- **Add deprecation notice to APIv3 Explorer
  ([22811](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22811))**

  Adds a notice to the APIv3 explorer to encourage users to use APIv4 instead.

- **Apiv4 entity parity (Work Towards
  [dev/core#2486](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2486):
  [22754](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22754),
  [22823](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22823),
  [22624](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22624) and
  [22799](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22799))**

  Adds "Extension", "Mailing", "MailingGroup" and "MailingJob" entities to
  APIv4.

- **APIv4 - Add tableName to Entity.get output
  ([22829](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22829))**

  Adds `tableName` to the APIv4 Entity.get action output, improving
  flexibility for virtual entities.

- **APIv4 Explorer - Add REST syntax
  ([22722](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22722))**

  Displays REST syntax in the APIv4 Explorer.

- **APIv4 - Add metadata about class args
  ([22831](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22831))**

  The CustomValue API is a virtual entity, where multiple api entities all get
  routed to the same class by virtue of all sharing the prefix "Custom_" and
  pass a class arg to the php factory functions e.g.
  CustomValue::get('MyCustomGroup').

  Instead of hard-coding this idea into the API Explorer now it's part of the
  entity metadata so that other APIs, notaby ECK, can use a similar pattern.

- **APIv4 Explorer - Add "copy" button to quickly copy code to clipboard
  ([22896](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22896))**

  Makes it easy to select and copy generated APIv4 Explorer code.

- **SearchKit - Update APIv3 Extension.get to use APIv4
  ([22788](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22788))**

  Updates SearchKit code to use newer version of the API when calling
  Extension.get.

- **SearchKit - Use crmDialogButtons for task popups
  ([22790](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22790))**

  Updates the buttons in SearchKit action popups to use standard dialog button
  formatting.

- **SearchKit - Add 'merge contacts' task
  ([22768](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22768) and
  [23035](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23035))**

  Adds a "merge contacts" task to SearchKit.

- **SearchKit - Customizable "No Results" text
  ([22770](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22770))**

  Makes it so users can customize the "No Results" text in SearchKit.

- **SearchKit - Improve import UI to handle update & preview the import
  ([22699](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22699))**

  SearchKit has an import/export SavedSearch feature which allows you to
  copy/paste api code in JSON format. This change enables update as well as create,
  and improves that UI to give better user feedback about what will happen when
  the import is run.

- **SearchKit - Support relative dates and datepicker with the DATE() sql fn
  ([22783](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22783))**

  Allows one to pick a relative or calendar date in conjunction with the DATE
  ONLY field transformation.

- **Civi\Api4\Queue - Allow use with hook_managed
  ([22796](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22796))**

  Flags the entity Queue so that it can be used with hook_managed.

- **Define more usable queue DX for multithreaded background work (Work Towards
  [dev/core#1304](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1304):
  [22812](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22812))**

  Expands the schema for civicrm_queue (et al). By configuring properties on
  civicrm_queue (et al), you can tell a generic queue-agent how to handle items
  from this queue.

- **ManagedEntities - Allow "match" param to convert existing records to â€¦
  ([22883](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22883))**

  This can help ease the pain of declaring managed entities which may or may not
  already exist - now they can be matched by name or other unique identifier.

- **Database update from 5.47.2 to 5.47.3 fails with a non en_US database.
  ([dev/core#3135](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3151):
  [23063](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23063))**  

### CiviContribute

- **Add basic contribution example base for contribution workflows
  ([22636](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22636))**

  Makes it so that one can preview Contribution Message Templates.

- **Remove time component from the {contribution.receive_date} token
  ([dev/core#3072](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3072):
  [23071](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23071))**

### CiviEvent

- **Introduce a way to link event participants from the associated booking.
  ([dev/user-interface#45](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/user-interface/-/issues/45):
  [22732](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22732))**

  Introduces a way to navigate to participants from the contribution view.

### CiviMail

- **Mailing - Add `serialize` and `add` to `template_options` field
  ([22785](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22785))**

  Improves the mailing schema metadata for template_options and template_type
  fields.

- **Start phasing out 'preferred_mail_format' (Work Towards
  [dev/core#2866](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2866):
  [22775](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22775),
  [22633](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22633) and
  [22635](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22635))**

  Ignores preferred mail format when sending a message. Instead sends both html
  and plain text versions and lets the email client decide which to show.
  Removes `preferred_mail_format` from email trait.

### Drupal Integraton

- **civicrm.drush.inc - Add 'civicrm-pipe' subcommand
  ([70](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8/pull/70))**

  Adds support for the subcommand `drush civicrm-pipe` (`drush cvpipe`).

  updated together

- **Switch extension downloader and extensions feed to use Guzzle HTTP library
  ([21097](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21097))**

  This fixes some situations (eg. shared servers with open_basedir restrictions
  in effect) where zip file was not downloaded properly and extension could not
  be updated. It also means that we are no longer using our custom
  CRM_Utils_HttpClient::fetch() function from within civicrm core.

- **RC Error: Call to undefined method
  CRM_Contact_Page_View_Summary::addExpectedSmartyVariables()
  ([dev/core#3104](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3104):

  incorrectly.
