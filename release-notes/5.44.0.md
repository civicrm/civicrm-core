## <a name="features"></a>Features

### Core CiviCRM

- **APIv4 - Add managed entity functionality
  ([21955](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21955))**

  APIv4 support for managed entities.

- **APIv4 - Add 'match' param to save action
  ([21857](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21857))**

  Adds a 'match' param to the APIv4 save action.

- **RelationshipCache - Add case_id column
  ([21845](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21845))**

  Makes it possible to show case relationships in SearchKit.

- **SearchKit - Support download formats xlsx, ods, pdf
  ([21351](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21351))**

  Extends download format support for SearchKit to include xlsx, ods and pdf.

- **SearchKit - default displays and ACL-aware links
  ([21929](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21929) and
  [22108](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/22108))**

  Gives every SavedSearch an auto-generated table display, and makes use
  of it in the UI to more conveniently view or embed a saved search without
  needing to manually create a display. In the UI it's referred to as the
  "Search results table" to emphasize the fact that it's the same table as
  shown on the "compose search" screen, and is not configurable like other
  displays.

- **SearchKit server-side rendering
  ([21820](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21820))**

  Improves SearchKit by doing more of the rendering work server-side. This
  allows for more nuanced permission checks of actions, better rendering of
  spreadsheets, and opens the door for advanced token formatting.

- **User experience improvement - CiviCRM Manage Events page, expand the Find
  Events criteria by default
  ([21953](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21953))**

  Improves user experience on the Manage Events page by making the Find Events
  Criteria open by default.

- **add 'minute' as recurring unit
  ([21893](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21893))**

  Adds minute as a recurring unit option.

  ### Wordpress Integration

- **Introduce "Shortcode Display Mode" setting and functionality
  ([258](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/258))**

  Introduces a new metabox with a "Shortcode Display Mode" setting.
