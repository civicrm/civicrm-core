## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviMember_: Restore support for APIv3 option "skipStatusCal" ([dev/core#2902](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2902), [dev/core#2904](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2904): [#21784](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21784), [#21796](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21796))**

  In some scenarios, new memberships may be recorded without their expected dates (`join_date`, `end_date`, etc). This affects callers using the `Membership` or `Order` API with option `skipStatusCal`.

* **_Search Kit_: Fix in-place edit ([#21769](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21769), [#21533](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21533))**
* **_Afform_: Fix loading of custom fields in search displays ([#21792](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21792))**
