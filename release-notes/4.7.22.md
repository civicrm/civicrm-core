## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-20561](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20561) Load Net_SMTP, Auth_SASL, Net_Socket via Composer
  ([10622](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10622))**

  This resolves an SMTP authentication issue by updating a patch for
  compatibility with the a newer release of `Net_SMTP`.

- **[CRM-20829](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20829) Install requirements fail because of port string
  ([10626](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10626))**

  This fixes a bug where new, GUI-based installations failed in Drupal and
  WordPress if the MySQL credentials relied on the default (implicit) port.

- **[CRM-20600](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20600) Display warning if asset-caching is likely to fail
  ([10644](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10644))**

  This mitigates an issue where pages based on AngularJS do
  not load because the site has a configuration problem.

- **[CRM-20834](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20834) Drupal user not created via Profile due to missing email field
  ([10636](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10636))**


### Backdrop Integration

- **Improve Views checkbox value handling
  ([37](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/pull/37))**

- **When creating a new Backdrop user, two corresponding CiviCRM contacts are created.
  ([22](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/issues/22))**

- **Access denied on Civi profile forms on user page
  ([31](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/issues/31))**

- **CiviCRM-related warning when saving Backdrop permissions page
  ([23](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/issues/23))**
