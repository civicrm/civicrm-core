## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_Custom Data_: Restricted visibility of `$groupTree` may cause some customizations to fail ([#27492](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/27492))**
* **_Status Check_: Display warning(s) if a previous upgrade left inconsistencies in the configuration of "Components" ([#27453](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/27453), [#27475](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/27475))**
* **_Upgrader_: Upgrades may fail if customizations depend on migrated component APIs ([dev/core#4521](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/4521): [#27481](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/27481))**
* **_Upgrader_: Upgrades may fail due to interaction between migrated component APIs, breadcrumbs, and views/entities ([dev/core#4605](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/4605): [#27518](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/27518))**
