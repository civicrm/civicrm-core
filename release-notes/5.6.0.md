  ([12757](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12757))**

  (ex: "spouse") and using the criteria "target contact is in group" on sites
  with large numbers of relationships of that type would take a long time,
  occasionally timing out entirely.

- **[dev/core#343](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/343) Long lines in
  contact name or address overflow mailing labels
  ([12691](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12691))**

  Pop-up w/out Params in URL
  ([12735](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12735))**

  This change fixes a bug where the load form function used to open a form in a
  pop up window was throwing an error if no parameters were included in the URL
  so no error is thrown if no parameters are sent (and no parameters are
  necessary).

- **[dev/core#349](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/349) Scheduled
  reminders list default sort does not work
  ([12701](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12701))**

  multiple lines.

- **Navigation - Don't reprocess fully-formed urls
  ([12702](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12702))**

  getting garbled so that relative urls, absolute urls and local urls are all
  processed correctly.

- **Fix CRM_ACL_API::whereClause to respect $contactId param
  ([12576](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12576))**

  (before this change it checked the permissions of the logged in user).

  Make datepicker
  accessible ([12631](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12631)) (Preliminary Work)**

  field.

  non-case-sensitivity.

  twice). ([12722](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12722))**

  one can call post hook after save and so that the pre hook is only called
  once.
