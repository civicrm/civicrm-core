### Core CiviCRM

- **Re-Thinking our Crypto implementation
  ([dev/core#2258](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2258):
  [19236](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19236),
  [19251](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19251),
  [19239](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19239),
  [19349](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19349),
  [237](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/237),
  [57](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/pull/57),
  [125](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/pull/125),
  [635](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/635), and
  [57](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8/pull/57))**

  This adds a new framework for encrypting setting values that are stored in the
  database.  An encryption key is defined upon installation, and the key can be
  rotated using APIv4.  Keys can also be managed with a new
  `hook_civicrm_crypto`.  The system allows for old keys to be retained for
  decrypting old values even as a new key is used for encrypting new ones.

  The only setting that is changed at this point is the SMTP password, as that
  was the only setting in core encrypted with `CRM_Utils_Crypt`.  However, this
  framework is available for extensions and will likely be adopted for other
  sensitive settings.

  You may optionally configure `CIVICRM_CRED_KEYS` in `civicrm.settings.php`
  upon upgrade.  Sites that define `smtpPassword` in their
  `civicrm.settings.php` file may need to update the value.  See
  [pull request 19239](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19239) for
  details.

  Meanwhile, `CRM_Utils_Crypt` is retained (but deprecated) for compatibility
  with the extensions that use it.

- **Add pre() and post() hooks for ufgroup entity
  ([dev/core#2199](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2199):
  [18995](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18995))**

  The pre and post hooks are now triggered when modifying profiles.

- **Add support for multi-value contact reference custom fields
  ([18941](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18941))**

  Makes it so users can configure a multi-value contact reference custom field.

- **Add missing state for South Korea
  ([19157](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19157))**

  This adds the special self-governing city Sejong to the state/province table
  for South Korea.

- **CRM_Core_Key - Provide more debugging hints about mismatched `qfKey` values
  ([19145](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19145))**

  The qfKey now has a prefix that corresponds with the form name.

- **Add min-width to flex columns for responsive layout on small screens
  ([19235](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19235))**

  This adjusts 2-column layouts on the main CiviCRM dashboard and Search Kit to
  collapse to 1 column on small screens.

- **APIv4 - Add "Permission.get" for listing available permissions
  ([19115](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19115))**

  Adds a new API method "Permission.get" to be used for administrative tools
  that allow one to choose/assign a permission.

- **APIv4: Support relative date range input
  ([19181](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19181))**

  Extends APIv4 to support relative date range inputs.

- **Free the joins! APIv4 explicit joins - can we remove the requirement for
  specific columns in the "on" clause? (Work Towards
  [dev/core#2271](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2271):
  [19275](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19275))**

  Allows greater flexibility in how explicit joins are performed in APIv4.

- **Non translatable fields in profile schema (Work Towards
  [dev/core#527](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/527):
  [19291](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19291))**

  Ensures the public title is used and translatable for on behalf profiles,
  confirm pages and thank you pages.

- **Proposal - add hook alterIndices
  (Work Towards [dev/core#2279](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2279):
  [19293](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19293) and
  [19288](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19288))**

  Adds indexes to `campaign.name` and `civicrm_group.cache_date`.

### CiviContribute

- **Wording change - change UI parts of contribution soft schema to soft credit
  ([dev/financial#158](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/-/issues/158):
  [19085](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19085))**

  Improves user experience of Search Kit/Afform by cleaning up language
  related to Soft Credits.

- **Cancel first contribution associated to membership, cancels the membership
  (Work Towards [dev/core#927](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/927):
  [19019](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19019))**

  Completes moving the logic for the contribution statuses "Cancel" and "Fail"
  from core to the `contributioncancelactions` extension.

- **Move financial acl warning from FinancialType BAO to extension.
  ([19283](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19283))**

  Moves more code from core to the financial acls extension.

  ([19083](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19083))**

  Adds the Contribution Soft entity to APIv4.

  ([19282](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19282))**

  Adds "Financial Type" and "Financial Account" entities to APIv4.

- **[APIv4] Permit using other SQL functions such as CONCAT within a
  GROUP_CONCAT ([19255](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19255))**

  Allows for SQL functions such as CONCAT to be used within a GROUP CONCAT,
  this maybe useful for example when trying to get all the line items associated with a
  contribution into one field.

- **Add default for boolean fields on financial_type
  ([19281](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19281) and
  [19335](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19335))**

  'is_reserved'.

- **Improve logging when a contribution is created/updated
  ([19252](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19252))**

  Improves logging when a Contribution is created/updated to improve the
  debugging experience.

### CiviEvent

- **Add a unique event ID so we can match pre/post Insert/Update
  ([19209](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19209))**

  Makes it so developers can use the event ID to link pre/post Insert/Update
  events for the same change.

### Search Kit

- **Search kit: Rewrite input widget to support IN sets, relative dates, BETWEEN
  groups, etc. ([19229](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19229))**

## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

### Core CiviCRM

- **jquery.validate.js update (includes CVE-2021-21252)
  ([dev/core#2324](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2324):
  [19457](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19457))**

  The jQuery Validate library contained a regular expression that was vulnerable
  to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service).

  ReDoS, or Regular Expression Denial of Service, is a vulnerability affecting
  poorly constructed and potentially inefficient regular expressions which can
  make them perform extremely badly given a creatively constructed input string.

  This offers security hardening by preventing a user from entering a string
  that could tie up their browser in validating it.

- **Fix updating custom field schema when toggling search or multiple
  ([18939](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18939))**

  Fixes a crash & possible data loss when changing a custom field of type
  "Country" or "State/Province" from a multi-select to single or vice versa.

- **Quick fix on summary actions conflict
  ([19067](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19067))**

  If multiple extensions insert items with the same weight into the contact
  summary actions drop-down, this ensures all menu items are displayed.

- **Greenwich: Fix Select2 free-tagging css bug
  ([19225](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19225))**

  Adds a CSS tweak to Greenwich that fixes a style conflict between Bootstrap
  and Select2.

- **APIv4: Normalize option list descriptions as plain text
  ([19237](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19237))**

  Ensures the description field comes through as plain text when fetching option
  lists from APIv4.

- **Unwanted mail blast sent by Scheduled Reminders (Work Towards
  [dev/core#365](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/365):
  [19068](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19068))**

  This adds a `created_date` column to the `action_schedule` table.  This is in
  anticipation of a change to prevent a newly-created scheduled reminder from
  triggering reminders that would be due to send prior to the creation of the
  reminder.

- **Editing a smartgroup created through the search builder renders the new
  block by force
  ([dev/core#2270](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2270):
  [19257](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19257))**

  Ensures the new record type and operator line only appear on the new search
  builder form (not when editing existing smart groups via search builder).

- **Merge all members into the same household when using select fields fails
  with a db error
  ([dev/core#2272](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2272):
  [19268](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19268))**

  Fixes a DB Error when exporting contacts using the "Merge Household members
  into their Households" setting and selecting fields for export.

- **civicrm-setup - Error during, uh, let's call them unit tests, if db port
  isn't specified
  ([dev/core#2286](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2286):
  [19324](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19324))**

  Avoids a notice of a missing db port during install.

- **Move non-compliant trigger_error out of logging
  ([dev/core#2241](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2241) and
  [dev/core#2240](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2240):
  [19256](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19256))**

  Makes CRM_Core_Error_Log more PSR3-compliant by not throwing errors itself,
  and removing dependence on the presence of a .git folder.

- **Tabs at top of extension list are no longer tabs
  ([dev/core#2233](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2233):
  [19138](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19138))**

  Fixes broken tabs on the profiles administration page.

- **Weird "null" after adding new tagset
  ([dev/core#2234](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2234):
  [19131](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19131))**

  Ensures the word 'null' is not displayed after adding a new tagset.

- **Stop preventing test runs and dev sites from seeing PHP deprecation notices
  ([19330](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19330))**

  Ensures notices appear based on the sites error reporting settings.

- **Unable to delete file with brackets in filename via ckeditor/kcfinder
  ([dev/user-interface#25](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/user-interface/-/issues/25):
  [304](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/pull/304))**

- **Obsolete wkhtmltopdfPath causes hard fail in event registration due to
  internal fatal error for the missing package
  ([dev/core#2028](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2028):
  [19311](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19311))**

  If the setting for the path to wkhtmltopdf is set, but nothing is there at
  that path, a system check message will appear and PDF generation will fall
  back to domPDF.

- **Contact import by CSV fails when string ends with "à"
  ([dev/core#2127](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2127):
  [19241](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19241))**

  In certain encodings, the &agrave; character can have the same byte as a
  non-breaking space.  This ensures that trimming non-breaking spaces does not
  accidentally snag multi-byte characters that share the same `0xA0` byte.

- **Activity Summary report is missing pagination
  ([dev/core#2174](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2174):
  [19146](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19146))**

  ([dev/core#2240](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2240):
  [19266](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19266))**

- **CiviCRM Export, Saved Export Field Mapping that contains custom fields which
  have been disabled or deleted are still loaded as "clear" values and cause the
  export download to fail with "DB Error: no such field"
  ([dev/core#2242](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2242):
  [19199](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19199))**

- **Inline email edit form fails to set is_bulkmail flag
  ([dev/core#2254](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2254):
  [19224](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19224))**

- **Accept PHP memory_limit of -1 as meeting requirement
  ([19340](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19340))**

- **Fix hook_civicrm_permission upgrade failure. Defer system-flush to
  'upgrade.finish' phase.
  ([19346](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19346))**

  On Drupal and Backdrop sites, the system flush was triggered after each
  incremental database update.  It is now deferred until the end of the upgrade
  process.

- **Fix APIv3 profile.getfields to return correctly keyed phone field
  ([19321](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19321))**

  ([dev/core#2173](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2173):
  [19057](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19057))**

- **Fatal error on contribution summary report (and probably others) when adding
  contacts to group
  ([19250](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19250))**

  This disables full group by mode for reports that are not optimized to work
  with it.

- **Stop passing ids as reference
  ([19204](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19204))**

- **Fix extensions tabs following deprecation of old tab code
  ([19130](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19130))**

- **php 7.4 compatibility

  [19331](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19331),
  [19353](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19353) and
