  that they can be disabled.

  ([19471](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19471))**

  [19546](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19546))**

  Deprecates direct calls to `isDevelopment()`.

  ([dev/core#2333](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2333):
  [19472](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19472))**

    - Preview button on table display form not working

- **Afform - Misc tweaks, validation & bug fixes
  ([19496](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19496))**

  Adds basic validation to server_route in the Afform GUI, only permitting
  paths beginning with "civicrm/". Also re-labels the menu item and page
  title to "Form Builder" and resets server_route and is_dashlet when cloning.
  And fixes several bugs in Afform & Search Kit.

- **Afform - Fix form submit button
  ([19460](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19460))**
