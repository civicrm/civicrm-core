### Core CiviCRM

- **Default to 'copy' for non-empty fields on merge screen
  ([dev/core#1339](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1339):
  [15595](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15595))**

  This updates the contact merge screen to default to copying data for all
  non-empty fields. This change makes it easier to keep too much data but harder
  to lose some.

- **Performance issue when exporting to CSV from reports with custom fields
  ([dev/report#19](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/19):
  [15248](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15248))**

  Performance improvements when exporting a report to CSV.

- **Memory error on creating large pdfs
  ([dev/core#574](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/574):
  [13232](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13232))**

  Improves performance when creating PDFs.

- **Update Country list: change Macedonia, Republic of into North Macedonia
  ([dev/core#1166](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1166):
  [15997](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15997))**

  Updates the name of "Macedonia, Republic of" to "North Macedonia" in
  accordance with the iso 3166-1 list.

- **Tagsets should display vertically in activity/new case forms
  ([dev/core#1346](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1346):
  [15649](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15649))**

  Improves the User interface of the "New Activity" and "New Case" forms by
  displaying the tag fields vertically instead of horizontally.

- **Make utf8mb4 status check language more for the general consumer
  ([15946](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15946))**

  This alters the language on the utf8mb4 status check so that it is a bit more
  general in nature and hopefully easier to digest for end users.

- **Include Metadata on advanced search form for membership, grant, pledge,
  contribution, and case fields
  ([15936](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15936),
  [15785](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15785), and
  [15928](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15928))**

  You can now set URL parameters for additional fields like
  `membership_join_date` and `pledge_payment_start_date` to pre-filter results
  on the advanced search form.

- **Fix activity search to work by url params
  ([15990](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15990))**

  You can now set URL parameters like `activity_date_time_high` to pre-filter
  results on the activity search form.

- **Replace all instances of CRM_Core_Fatal with throw new CRM_Core_Exception
  (Work towards [dev/core#560](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/560):
  [15903](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15903),
  [15770](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15770),
  [15941](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15941),
  [15775](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15775) and
  [15822](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15822))**

  Work towards throwing exceptions instead of fatal errors.

- **Remove background opacity in menus; improving accessibility/readability
  ([15847](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15847))**

  The CiviCRM menu is now opaque to improve readability.

- **Improve datePicker placeholder/icons
  ([15848](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15848))**

  Small tweaks to the datepicker widget to improve flexibility & consistency.

- **modified shared address note under contact dashboard
  ([15666](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15666) and
  [15769](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15769))**

  Improves the note below the Shared Address field to include a link to the
  contact that the address lives on to make it easier for get to the shared
  address to edit it.

- **Grant in Edit mode doesn't show the associated contact and standardize all
  screens accordingly. (Work Towards
  [dev/core#1065](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1065):
  [15757](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15757),
  [15833](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15833) and
  [15840](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15840))**

  This standardizes edit screens for participant, grant, and membership records
  to ensure that a clickable link to the associated contact is included in a
  consistent way.

- **Temporary tables should follow consistent naming convention (Work Towards
  [dev/core#183](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/183):
  [15795](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15795),
  [15798](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15798),
  [15819](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15819),
  [15793](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15793),
  [15792](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15792),
  [15874](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15874),
  [15821](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15821),
  [15823](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15823),
  [15826](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15826),
  [15820](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15820),
  [15825](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15825),
  [15876](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15876), and
  [16155](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16155))**

  Begins work to enforce a common naming convention for temporary tables.

### CiviContribute

- **Develop getter & setter structure for Payment classes (Work Towards
  [dev/financial#82](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/82):
  [15697](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15697),
  [16052](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16052),
  [16060](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16060), and
  [16081](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16081))**

  This PR adds a new class, `Civi\Payment\PropertyBag` which is designed to
  offer a consistent object for holding payment parameters as they are sent to
  and from payment processors.  For now, the legacy array of parameters is still
  valid, so this will not have much immediate impact, but it lays the groundwork
  for future work.

- **Always display amount paid even if it is 0.00. Blank looks like it's missing
  data rather than nothing paid
  ([16021](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16021))**

  This improves user experience by displaying contributions of 0 as 0 instead
  of blank.

### CiviMail

- **CiviMail - Only display "Headers and Footers" if there are headers and
  footers ([15326](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15326))**

  Makes it so when creating a CiviMail Mailing the "Headers and Footers" tab
  only displays if there are Headers and/or Footers configured on the site.

### Drupal Integration

- **Add participant is_test field to views
  ([590](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/590))**

  Makes the Participant `is_test` field available in views.

### PayPal Implementation

- **PayPalImpl: Add SOLUTIONTYPE parameter that triggers allowing to pay without
  having to create a paypal account.
  ([15523](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15523))**

  Adds a `SOLUTIONTYPE` parameter to the PayPal checkout values so that one can
  make a contribution without having to create an account.

## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

### Core CiviCRM

- **CiviCRM Option Group with a name containing spaces cannot have any options
  added, error message is shown also impacts the in-place option editor
  ([dev/core#1405](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1405) and
  [dev/core#1447](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1447):
  [15937](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15937) and
  [16033](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16033))**

  Option group names are no longer exposed for editing, as they are now
  automatically generated from the title.  On upgrade, existing option group
  names that contain spaces will be rewritten.  *Extensions that provide or rely
  upon option group names that contain spaces will need to be rewritten.*

  Upon upgrade, if rewriting an option group name will duplicate another option
  group's name, that option group will be skipped and a post-upgrade message
  will show the details.

- **Quicksearch with phone filter doesn't work with non-numeric character
  ([dev/core#1420](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1420):
  [15955](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15955))**

- **Option to open navigation item in new window (if present)
  ([dev/core#1398](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1398):

  [15981](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15981),
  [15988](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15988) and
  [15980](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15980))**

  Removes a misleading PHPDoc type hint for the `$value` parameter in
  `CRM_Core_BAO_Setting::setItem()` and updates tests that use this function.

- **Only add in the metadata for advanced search if user has access to the
  relevant component
  ([15987](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15987))**

  Ensures the user has access to the relevant component before adding metadata
  for that component to the advanced search form.

- **Fix api explorer formatting IS NULL clauses
  ([15817](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15817))**

  Fixes a formatting issue in the api explorer output where IS NULL and IS NOT
  NULL clauses would output invalid code due to the missing value piece of the
  clause.

- **Add in translation function around newly converted statusBounce messages
  ([15774](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15774))**

  ([15965](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15965))**

- **translate strings
  ([15858](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15858))**

  Some text in the extension manager was not wrapped in a translation function.

- **Filter contact sub-type by "is not one of" fails
  ([dev/report#23](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/23):

### CiviCampaign

- **Activities not visible if they have a campaign_id & contact does not have
  'administer CiviCampaign'
  ([dev/core#1444](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1444):
  [16057](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16057))**

### CiviCase

- **Case Activities Report includes core activities *always*
  ([dev/core#1366](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1366):
  [15882](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15882) and
  [15877](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15877))**

- **Case search with force URL parameters gives php warning
  ([dev/core#1410](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1410) and
  [dev/core#1414](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1414):
  [15920](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15920) and
  [15924](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15924))**

- **CiviCase - Make static function `allActivityTypes()` static
  ([15839](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15839))**

### CiviContribute

  ([dev/financial#100](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/100):
  [15771](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15771))**

  To avoid users accidentally setting invalid statuses, this removes the
  statuses "Partially Paid", "Cancelled", and "Failed" from the `Payment Status`
  field when recording a payment for a Contribution related to a Membership.

  Progress" from the `Payment Status` field when  recording a payment for a
  Contribution related to an Event.

  Fixes the LYBUNT charts.

- **allow PCP report to filter on contribution status
  ([16024](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16024))**

  The PCP report template lists all personal campaign pages with the total
  number of contributions made against each PCP page and the total amount
  raised. Before this change the report had no filter for Contribution Status,
  so canceled contributions were showing and throwing off the totals.  There is
  now a filter for contribution status allowing users to filter this list as
  they wish.

- **Fix api Payment.create to support overpayments
  ([15909](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15909))**

- **Move greeting handling up as it is not paymentValidation dependent
  ([15904](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15904))**

  conditional on processing a payment.

  [16000](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16000))**
