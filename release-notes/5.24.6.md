## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: The "Tax and Invoice" settings are not consistently saved/loaded/upgraded ([dev/core#1724](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1724): [#17188](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17188))**

  In the screen "Administer => CiviContribute => CiviContribute Component Settings", the settings for "Enable Tax and
  Invoicing" (et al) may have been loaded/saved incorrectly.  If you rely on the settings, and if you've previously
  used an affected version (5.23.0 - 5.24.5), then you may wish to review the settings to ensure they are correct.

* **_CiviReport_: The "Activity Details" report skips certain filters ([dev/core#1729](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1729): [#17200](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17200))**
