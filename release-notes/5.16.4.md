## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

- **_Smart Groups_: Relative date filters saved incorrectly ([dev/core#1226](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1226):
  [#15201](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15201), [#15169](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15169))**

  On 5.16.0 - 5.16.3, if you saved a smart-group with a relative date
  filter, it would incorrectly save the configuration.  
  
  If you recently created or modified a smart-group with a date-filter, please update it.
  For discussion of cleanup tips, please use [dev/core#1226](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1226).
