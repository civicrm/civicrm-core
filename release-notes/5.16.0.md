### Core CiviCRM

- **Allow extensions to define CSS themes / Add a configuration setting for when
  to load custom CSS
  ([CRM-18792](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-18792) /
  [dev/core#378](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/378):
  [14551](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14551) and
  [12929](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12929))**

  Adds an option to the "Display Preferences" settings form to allow users to
  more finely tune when CiviCRM's css is loaded. On WordPress and Joomla two
  options are available the "Backend Theme" and "Frontend Theme", on Drupal and
  Backdrop, the administration screen "Display Preferences" presents a singular
  "Theme" option.

- **Clean up use of DAO::nullArray
  ([dev/core#1047](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1047):
  [14556](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14556),
  [14555](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14555) and
  [14550](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14550))**

  Improves code stability by removing the unnecessary function
  `CRM_Core_DAO::_nullArray`.

- **Consolidate handling of conflicts between the batch job and get_conflicts
  api ([14685](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14685))**

  Improves code consistency by ensuring that merge conflicts are stored during
  batch_merge to the prev_next cache with the same format as when the api calls
  get_conflicts, the code doing this wrangling is moved from the api to the BAO
  layer.

- **Better support for hookable menubar colors
  ([14944](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14944))**

  More colors in the menu, including the base color, highlight color, and text
  color, can be modified with hooks.

- **Add csv reader package
  ([14524](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14524))**

  Adds the CSV processing utility, league/csv ^9.2 which will help with future
  PRs which introduce more test-coverage for CSV outputs and help cleanup some
  of the csv code down the way.

- **Improve protected field metadata
  ([14679](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14679))**

  Adds more robust metadata to fields protected by permissions in a format that
  can be directly passed into `CRM_Core_Permissions::check()`.

- **Move api_key read/write permission checks from api to BAO
  ([14660](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14660))**

  Moves the logic for checking the api_key field permissions from the api layer
  to the BAO layer so it can be reused by api4 and other things.

- **Add a configuration setting for when to load custom CSS (initial work for
  [dev/core#378](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/378):
  [14876](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14876))**

  A new function, `CRM_Utils_System::isFrontEndPage()`, indicates whether a page
  is considered "front-end".

- **Permit sort_name as a url parameter on advanced search
  ([14475](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14475) and
  [14920](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14920))**

  You can now set `sort_name=x` in the URL on the advanced search form.  In
  doing this, the sort name field is now defined through metadata rather than
  *ad hoc*.

- **Menubar - Improve flexibility & remove hardcoded values
  ([14924](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14924))**

  The menu no longer relies on hardcoded pixel dimensions to determine mobile
  appearance, and it replaces references to the ID selector `crm-container` with
  the class selector of the same name (which is used more broadly).

  This also resolves
  [dev/core#1127](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1127).

- **Handle relative start & end dates passed to datepicker widget
  ([14632](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14632))**

  Adds some client-side logic to the datepicker widget that was previously done
  server-side. Paves the way for afform.

- **Improve utilities & tests for working with js notation
  ([14588](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14588),
  [14537](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14537) and
  [14586](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14586))**

  Removes dependence on an external library & improves robustness & accuracy of
  reading/writing js notation. Adds a utility function for getting properties of
  a Javascript option without parsing them. Adds a utility function  and a
  test for dealing with data in js notation.

- **i18n - Improve multilingual popup for text and wysiwyg fields
  ([14578](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14578))**

  Fixes copying of values between multilingual popup and main form for wysiwyg
  fields and makes text fields larger in multilingual pop-up.

- **Buttons inconsistencies
  ([dev/core#347](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/347):
  [14136](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14136) and
  [14509](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14509))**

  Adds support for "button" elements in CiviCRM ajax popup forms in addition to
  the input type=button/submit and the "a class=button". This is a first step
  towards cleaning up button handling from a theming perspective. Adds
  buttons to 'Cleanup caches and update paths' in standard way

- **Display description next to 'paperclip' file icon - usually the filename
  ([14501](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14501))**

  When viewing custom files displays the description (usually the filename) next
  to the paperclip.

- **Address BAO - Handle standard 'custom' param as well as individual fields
  ([14535](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14535))**

  Ensures that the Address BAO can handle both raw unformatted custom field
  input and processed custom field inputs.

- **Update PSR16 handling for multisite extension legacy caching group
  ([14505](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14505))**

  Only use a Legacy group if using a version of org.civicrm.multisite 2.6 or
  below.

- **Improve I18n schema by including comments and default and NOT NULL or NULL
  statements to be more consistent with non lingual schema
  ([14484](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14484))**

  Adds more information to the I18n schema structure so that when the
  translated schema is created it is more similar to the non multilingual schema.

- **Add a couple customField pseudoconstants
  ([14494](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14494))**

  Adds a couple missing option lists to the schema so that they show up in the
  api explorer for the CustomField entity.

- **Deprecate ARCHIVE format for CiviCRM Database Logging (continues work for
  [dev/core#663](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/663):
  [14256](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14256))**

  Switches to using InnoDB for extended log tables instead of the ARCHIVE
  format.

- **ActivityForm - Redirect to contact page or activity view in standalone mode
  ([14522](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14522))**

  When using the "standalone" New Activity form, moves from always redirecting
  to the dashboard after saving to redirecting to the contact page (if 1
  contact) and the activity view screen (if multiple).

### CiviEvent

- **URL support for some params in event search
  ([14477](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14477))**

  Adds Event Search URL support for the params: sort_name, participant_status_id,
  participant_register_date_low, participant_register_date_high, and
  participant_register_date_relative. Date format is a string of numbers YmdHIS
  (ex: 20180101).

- **Add checklist-model angular module
  ([14634](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14634))**

  Adds the angular `checklist-model` library required by form builder.

- **Reduce deadlocks on inserting custom data by only using 'ON DUPLICATE' when
  it is not a new row
  ([14605](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14605))**

  Reduce deadlocks when processing contributions with custom data. This
  specifically makes the custom data insert SQL more efficient.

- **Fix url support for receive_date_high & receive_date_low
  ([14594](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14594) and
  [14611](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14611))**

  contribution search form for the following fields: receive_date_high,
  receive_date_low, contribution_cancel_date_high, contribution_cancel_date_low
  and invoice_number=9. Deprecates and continues to support the start date being
  passed to contribution search as "start=2018-01-01".

- **Deprecate contribution_date as a parameter

  object.

  Changes the label of the Owner Membership ID in reports from "Membership Owner
  ID" to "Primary Membership".
