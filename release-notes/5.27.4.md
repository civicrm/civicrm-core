## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviCase_: Action links are missing text labels ([dev/core#1899](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1899):
  [#17947](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17947))**
* **_CiviContribute_: When editing "Amounts", default is mis-saved ([dev/core#1911](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1911):
  [#17960](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17960))**

  If you recently edited any "Amounts", then please review and verify that the default is correct.
  Mis-saved defaults can cause problems when submitting contributions.

* **_CiviMail_: Blasts sent via Job Manager do not recover from errors ([dev/mail#72](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/-/issues/72):
  [#18017](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18017))**
* **_WordPress_: `[civicrm.files]` is incorrect on older sites ([dev/wordpress#66](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/66):
  [#17868](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17868))**

  This fixes a regression affecting older WordPress deployments by partially reverting
  [dev/wordpress#47](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/47).  This means that some WordPress configurations
  (eg Polylang) may return to being unsupported.  The issue is scheduled to be revisited circa 5.29.
