## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviCampaign_: Fix error when reserving respondents for a survey ([#19811](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19811))**
* **_Upgrader_: Fix handling of "group_title" in certain upgrade-paths ([dev/translation#58](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/translation/-/issues/58): [#19740](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19740))**
* **_D8 / Asset Builder_: Fail gracefully when certain resources cannot be generted ([dev/core#2137](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2137): [#18830](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18830))**

  A common misconfiguration on Drupal 8+ is to omit `enable-patching`. This currently manifests as an error about `crm-menubar.css`. The change does not fix the misconfiguration, but it makes the error more manageable.
