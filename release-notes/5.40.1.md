## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_Contact Dashboard_: If "Pledges" are disabled, then dashboard shows incorrect links ([dev/core#2740](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2740): [#21051](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21051))**
* **_Search Kit_: "Actions" menu does not display for some users ([#21045](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21045))**
* **_WordPress_: Restore rendering for certain page-views ([dev/wordpress#107](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/107), [dev/wordpress#112](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/112): [wordpress#255](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/255))**

  A recent bug-fix from v5.39.0 ([dev/wordpress#91](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/91)) leads to complex interactions with various themes and plugins. This fix has been reverted until a more durable fix is developed.
