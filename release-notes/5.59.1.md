## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: Contribution pages crash if CiviMember is disabled ([#25729](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/25729))**
* **_Tokens_: Abbreviated state/province does not display ([dev/core#4147](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/4147): [#25704](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/25704))**
* **_Multilingual_: Site reports `DB Error: -32` after running upgrade ([dev/core#4155](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/4155): [#25733](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/25733))**

  If you previously ran the 5.59.0 upgrade on a multilingual site and have a persistent fatal error, then you may wish to (a) consult the Gitlab discussion for resolution steps or (b) rollback to the original DB and upgrade to 5.59.1 instead.
