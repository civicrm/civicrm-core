## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_Drupal_: Fix compatibility with Drupal v9.5.9 ([drupal#82](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8/pull/82), [#26159](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/26159))**

  Drupal v9.5.9 modified the handling of "Route" data. This revision changes the CiviCRM-Drupal routes for compatibility. Administrators should manually clear Drupal caches (`drush cc` or "_Administration > Configuration > Development_").
