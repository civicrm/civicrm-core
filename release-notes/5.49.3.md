## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: Fix calculation of unit-price for recurring contributions ([#23566](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23566))**

  The inaccurate unit-price did not affect payment processing, but it would produce inaccurate records.  The effect would be apparent when synchronizing records to another accounting system (eg Xero).

* **_CiviContribute_: Fix error displaying empty values of "{contribution.tax_amount}" ([#23528](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23528))**
* **_Custom Fields_: Fix Javascript error when using certain translation data ([dev/core#3436](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3436): [#23499](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23499))**
* **_Guzzle_: Update to v6.5.6 ([#23584](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23584))**

  This applies a prophylactic security update. It is not believed to impact the security of CiviCRM deployments.
