## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_Scheduled Reminders_: Fix storage of "Limit To" option. ([dev/core#3464](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3464), [dev/core#3465](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3465): [#23497](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23497))**

  On sites which used 5.49.0 or 5.49.1, scheduled reminders could store incorrect values of the "Limit To" option.  This
  can lead to excessive notifications. The upgrader should significantly reduce this risk, but it may advise you to
  review the configuration. ([Learn more](https://civicrm.org/redirect/reminders-5.49))
