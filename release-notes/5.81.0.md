## <a name="features"></a>Features

### Core CiviCRM

- **Add schema support for bigint
  ([31502](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31502))**

  Makes it possible to use the sql type `bigint` in the schema.

- **ContactSummary - Make notes tab hierarchical
  ([31432](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31432))**

  Makes the contact summary notes tab a collapsed hierarchical display.

- **allow read-only fields in FormBuilder
  ([30757](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/30757))**

  Makes it possible to add read-only fields in FormBuilder.

- **Update SavedSearch_Administer_ProfileFields.mgd.php
  ([31509](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31509))**

  Makes Field Names inline editable on the Profile fields form for AdminUI
  users.

- **AdminUI - dynamically generate afform tabs for CustomGroups of style Tab
  with table ([31503](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31503))**

  Adds a SearchKit and tab for each CustomGroup where style = Tab with table for
  AdminUi users.

- **afform - provide useful console error for invalid fields
  ([31472](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31472))**

  It's easy to end up with an invalid field on an afform e.g. when you disable
  a custom field. This makes it easier to find and fix.

- **Update afsearchProfiles.aff.html
  ([31510](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31510))**

  Adds an afform search filter 'created by'.

- **Add SearchKit Reports extension
  ([31458](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31458))**

  Adds a placement tag to designate certain (search) afforms as "Afform
  Reports". Add a listing for end users to open these reports.

- **SearchKit - Add search templates feature
  ([31528](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31528))**

  Adds a new tab for searchkit templates, and a button allowing any existing
  search to be saved as a template.

- **Add APIv4 Contact.getMergedTo/getMergedFrom actions
  ([31336](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31336))**

  Adds the APIv4 Contact actions getMergedFrom and getMergedTo. These are the
  APIv4 equivalent of the existing v3 actions.

- **Api4 CustomGroup.get - use in-memory cache to answer simple calls
  ([31508](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31508))**

  Performance improvement for the APIv4 custom group entity get action.

- **Display Custom Fields on ContributionPage settings
  ([31487](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31487) and
  [31533](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31533))**

  Adds the display of Custom Fields on ContributionPages.

### Drupal Integration

- **ClassLoader - Fix loading when using composer `path` repository (symlink
  mode) with CLI ([31512](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31512))**

  Helps composer-style sites (D8/9/10/11) use composer's path repository option.
  The path option helps you incorporate a local working-copy of the source-code
  into a more complex composer site-build. composer often implements this option
  using symlinks.

### Standalone Integration

- **Standalone login improvements (message/theme/events)
  ([31149](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/31149))**

  Improves login experience for standalone sites.
