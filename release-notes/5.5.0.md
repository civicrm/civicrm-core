#### Api4 Extension now included
The [Api v4 extension](https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.api4) is now included in the CiviCRM download.
It provides the latest version of CiviCRM's api for integration with extensions and other software; is is still under active development but considered complete enough to use.
Because it is not yet used by CiviCRM core, it is disabled by default.
If you install an extension which requires this api, it will be enabled automatically.
