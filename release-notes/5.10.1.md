- **[13570](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13570) Fix Regression
  where recieve date field being required broke backend credit card contribution
  form**

  To fix another problem the receive date field was made a required field, this 
  subsequently broke the back office credit card form as the receive date isn't
  exposed on that form.
