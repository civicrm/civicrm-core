## <a name="features"></a>Features

### Core CiviCRM

- **Add unique names and unique title for recurrings.
  ([14820](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14820))**

  Adds the key `unique_title` to the entity definition schema for situations where
  multiple entities may be involved (e.g advanced search) and disambiguation is
  needed

- **Add query dispatcher to allow query modification
  ([CRM-20445](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20445):
  [259](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/pull/259) and
  [180](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/pull/180))**

  Allows a query to be modified from an extension, for example by prepending
  data like '/* Query run by user 45*/'.

- **Add support for bulkcreates
  ([dev/core#1093](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1093):
  [14829](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14829) and
  [14694](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14694))**

  Adds a bulkCreate function for CustomField so that one can create multiple
  custom fields at the same time. This sets the stage for a new protocol
  for how bulk create actions could look from a code point of view.

- **Make admin panels hookable
  ([dev/core#1104](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1104):
  [14734](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14734))**

  Adds the hook `alterAdminPanel` to allow extension developers to hide and show
  elements on the admin screen.

- **[EXPORT] add getPreview function
  ([14782](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14782))**

  Adds a function to allow preview of export results.

- **Export help info does not match code
  ([dev/core#1120](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1120):
  [14830](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14830))**

  Improves the export UI when one selects "Merge All Contacts with the Same
  Address" so that the field "Postal Greeting (merging > 2 contacts)" reads
  "Postal Greeting (when merging contacts)" and the field "Addressee (merging >
  2 contacts)" reads "Addressee (when merging contacts)" and the code behind
  these fields so that merging greater than 2 contacts or less than 2 contacts
  functions the same.

- **Can't show contact subtype in search views
  ([core#1130](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1130):
  [14840](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14840))**

  This change ensures that one can use Contact Subtype as a result column in
  Search Views.

- **[REPORT] Allow extensions to join address, email and phone tables without
  limiting to primary fields
  ([14941](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14941))**

  Allows reports to join the address email and phone tables without limiting to
  just primary fields and add a test to ensure this functionality stays in
  place.

- **Use metadata for getOptions abbreviation & include currency symbol
  ([14969](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14969))**

  Refactors the "abbreviation" mode in getOptions to be more consistently
  metadata-driven, and adds the currency symbol as an abbreviation to fetch.

- **Error log improvements: Provide severity level and use Civi::log()
  ([14222](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14222))**

  Improves the Error Logging functionality ` CRM_Core_Error::debug_var` by
  adding an optional severity level parameter and using `Civi::log()`.

- **Move the code to add employer from relationship backoffice form to BAO
  ([14950](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14950))**

  Makes it so one can add the employer contact after a current 'Employee of'
  relationship is created and adds an optional relationship.create API parameter
  `is_current_employer`.

- **[METADATA] Add titles to Mapping xml & DAOs
  ([14867](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14867) and
  [14975](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14975))**

  Adds some missing metadata to the Mapping & MappingField entities.

- **Fix support for relative dates in urls
  ([14893](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14893))**

  Improves url support for relative dates for fields that have been converted to
  use datepicker.

- **Add default location for API v3 creates of Address, IM, OpenID and Phone
  ([14885](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14885))**

- **EntityPageTrait: Set logged in contact ID as default if one is not
  specified, this allows permission checks etc. to work properly.
  ([14620](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14620))**

  Currently the `entitypagetrait` is only in use by
  CRM_Contact_Page_View_Relationship. However the plan is to extend it to other
  pages too, this PR updates it to get the logged in contact ID if none is
  passed in - so it can be used on non-contact forms (eg. event lists).

- **Move log and compilation dirs from "Runtime" to "Paths"
  ([14718](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14718))**

  This is an update to the path-handling convention for data folders that allows
  more intuitive management of file-paths.

- **Use select2 to display field mappings
  ([14794](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14794))**

  On the "Export Options" Screen for the "Use Saved Field Mapping" select field
  adds the Description for the option (if one exists).

- **expose smarty's compile_check to be overridden in civicrm.settings.php
  ([14706](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14706))**

  Exposes the Smarty variable `compile_force` so that it can be overridden from
  civicrm.settings.php because having `compile_force` set to FALSE in some
  environments has a positive impact on page rendering performance.

- **[dev/core#538](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/538) Activity search
  (advanced search) by subject - is exact match only
  ([14703](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14703))**

  Makes searching on some fields (including but not limited to invoice_number,
  activity details, activity subject and activity location) do a "Like" search
  as opposed to a strict match search consistently whether using the advanced
  search or a component specific search.

- **Unable to use url search arguments in 'Advanced Search' using force=1
  ([Core/dev#692](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/692):
  [14921](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14921))**

  Adds support for the url search arguments 'contact_tags' and 'email' for the
  'Advanced Search' form.

### CiviContribute

- **Extend contribute search url parsing to advanced search
  ([14939](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14939))**

  This change extends the url parameters accepted by the Advanced Search form to
  include the search url parameters accepted by the Contribution Search form.

- **Improve performance on getSoftContribution details - only run one query
  instead of one per contribution
  ([14747](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14747))**

  Improves performance when retrieving bulk contributions.

- **Switch priceset selector to addField method
  ([14843](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14843))**

  Switches to adding price set fields using schema metadata instead of hard
  coded metadata.

- **Set title using standard form method and use for success message on
  contributionpage
  ([14615](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14615))**

  Switches to using a standard form method for assigning title on the Manage
  Contribution page screen so the title can be accessed during postprocess.

### CiviEvent

- **Improve handling of 'Manage Event' title
  ([14614](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14614))**

  Switches to using a standard form method for assigning title on the Manage
  Event screen so the title can be accessed during postprocess.

### CiviMail

- **Changed the title and description of profile_add_to_group_double_optin
  ([14852](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14852))**

  Improves help text by updating the profile_add_to_group_double_optin and
  profile_double_optin to have different titles and descriptions.

### CiviMembership

- **Add serialization metadata for MembershipType api
  ([14954](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14954))**

  Adds metadata for serializing the membership_type fields
  'relationship_type_id' and 'relationship_direction'.

- **Switch create MembershipPayment to use API
  ([14886](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14886))**

  Simplifies and standardizes the creation of a MembershipPayment when using a
  "live" payment method.

  ([dev/report#17](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/17):
  [14744](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14744))**

  Ensures when the postal code suffix column is displayed it returns the suffix,

  [14320](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14320))**

  Switches to invoking alterReportVars hook before grand total and section total
  calculations instead of after so that when alterReportVars hook is used to
  alter values in report rows those changes are taken into account when
  totaling.

- **Delete repeating activities not working as intended
  ([dev/core#1050](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1050):
  [14784](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14784))**

  Ensures that when the user opts to delete multiple repeat activities, the
  specified activities are actually deleted.

- **Bad popup on update recurring screen
  ([dev/core#1061](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1061):
  [14964](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14964))**

  the tab was loaded.

- **Contact Reference fields are not updated when merging contacts
  ([dev/core#1109](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1109):

- **[Report] Fix handling of location type in Reports
  ([14942](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14942))**

  Fixes a bug in the processing of the `location_type_id` field for addresses in
  reports. Before this change the array key's name was "is_primary" which led to
  showing the location type as either blank or Home which is generally the label
  for location type id 1.

- **[Export] Convert testGender Export to new test format.
  ([14914](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14914))**

  This change ensures that gender labels longer than 16 characters are supported
  when exporting.

- **[EXPORT] Minor fixes to the export form
  ([14785](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14785))**

  number of warnings from the string extraction script.

- **Fix removeNullContactTokens compatibility with custom tokens
  ([14943](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14943))**

   Fixes notices and warnings with custom tokens when updating a contact record.

- **Do not launch raw js alert jqueryValidation fails
  ([14854](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14854))**

  For sites with Jquery validation turned on disables js alerts.

- **Invalidate smart group cache for group following deletion of group_contact
  row ([14672](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14672))**

  Ensures that when a contact is removed from a smart group they are removed
  from the cache instantly.

- **Ensure that if present the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR IP address is used instead
  of the SERVER_ADDR when logging items from the IDS
  ([14833](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14833))**

  Ensures the `SERVER_ADDR` is only used if `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` cannot be.

- **Set profile greeting fields based on actual contact type
  ([14845](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14845))**

   Sets greeting options in a profile based on the actual contact type being
   edited instead of based off the profile type.

- **Menubar - Improve flexibility & remove hardcoded values
  ([14839](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14839))**

  Minor tweak to crm.menubar.js to make it less reliant on the presence of a
  `<div id="crm-container">` which may not be present on non-civicrm pages. Also
  tweaks the js to remove hardcoded pixel values to work better with theme
  overrides.

- **Use singleton to get session instead of relying on ->_session being set
  elsewhere ([14832](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14832))**

  Calls CRM_Core_Session::singleton() on the `CRM_Profile_Form` instead of
  relying on $this->_session being set.

- **Remove the only two defined fonts from selectors
  ([14815](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14815))**

  Before this change CiviCRM was setting h3 tags on front end forms to have the
  font arial. After this change h3 tags on front end forms inherit their fonts
  from the theme (like the rest of the h tags).

  [14951](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14951))**

### CiviCase

- **Case summary report filters incorrectly for case type
  ([dev/core#1118](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1118):
  [14827](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14827))**

  Fixes a bug where applying the case type filter in the case summary report
  resulted in two case types being reported where only one is selected in the
  case type filter.

- **CiviCase singleton activity warning has wrong url
  ([dev/core#1115](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1115):
  [14824](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14824))**

  Fixes a bug where if a case type has an activity type (other than open case)
  with max_instances set to 1 and a user attempted to create a second activity
  of that type for that case type the warning presented to the user would
  contain a broken link to edit the existing activity of that type so that the
  link works as expected.

### CiviContribute

- **[dev/core#1133](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1133) Payment method

  ([dev/core#1170](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1170):
  [14985](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14985))**

  Fixes the redirect when an anonymous user goes to `/user` to point to
  `/user/login` instead of `/user?destination...`.

### Drupal Integration

- **confirmation screen shows internal profile name not public title (reg screen
  shows public title)
  ([dev/drupal#72](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/72):
  [14960](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14960))**

  Fixes a bug whereby the front end profile title was not being used in event
  confirm & thank you screens & confirmation emails.

- **[regression] `cv` fails on CiviCRM 5.15.0
  ([dev/drupal#75](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/75):
  [14772](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14772))**

  Fixes a call to `languageNegotiationURL` that was causing cv to fail on Drupal
  8 sites.

- **Fail more gracefully when attempting to install on PHP 5.x
  ([dev/drupal#79](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/79):
  [15082](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15082) and
  [15089](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15089))**

  Raises the `MINIMUM_PHP_VERSION` from 5.6 to 7.0 in the metadata because when
  upgrading via drush or Drupal web UI to Civi 5.16+ on PHP 5.6, the Civi
  class-loader fails to initialize.  The installer is also updated to check the
  PHP version before proceeding with the class loader.

- **Migrate CivicrmHelper::parseUrl() to CRM_Utils_System_Drupal8::parseUrl().
  ([14696](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/14696))**

  Fixes a bug when installing Drupal8 thru the command line.

- **Fix path for civicrm.settings.php when installed in profiles/
  ([552](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/552))**

  Ensures that when CiviCRM is installed in a Drupal distribution profile under
  `profiles/<profile_name>/modules/[contrib]`, the function `civicrm_conf_init()`
  returns the proper path for file civicrm.settings.php before this change
  calling an API using REST would result in a "Could not load the settings
  file..." error.
