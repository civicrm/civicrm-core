## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

- **([dev/core#681](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/681)) CiviCase - Fatal error
  submitting "Change Case Status" form
  ([13595](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13595))**

  There was a fatal error generated when submitting the change case status form
  because the end_date was not properly converted to MySQL date format.

- **([dev/core#721](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/721)) Role Based ACL
  Not Working With Smart Groups
  ([13597](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13597))**

  Fixed a recent regression whereby ability to see contacts permissioned by an
  ACL over a smart group depended on the freshness of the group cache.

- **([dev/core#715](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/715)) Relationships - Fix regression
  preventing deletion of relationship types in UI.
  ([13590](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13590))**
