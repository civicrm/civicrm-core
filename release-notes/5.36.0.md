  ([dev/core#1750](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1750):
  [18299](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18299))**

  Replaces tokens in Activity content for sent emails.

  ([dev/core#2077](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2077):
  [19728](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19728))**

  Provides a binding for CRM_Utils_REST in the conventional routing system.

- **Improve activity import to support updates (Work Towards
  [dev/core#2308](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2308):
  [19421](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19421),
  [19553](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19553) and

  Makes it possible to create metadata-driven chain select fields.

  ([dev/core#2420](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2420):
  [19668](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19668))**

  Adds text to report template saying no results found if that is the case.

- **Search kit navigation - once I've created an afform it's hard to edit it
  ([dev/core#2389](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2389):
  [19617](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19617))**

  Improves SearchKit admin page by including links to edit.

- **Afform - Add 'View Page' link from afform edit screen
  ([19645](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19645))**

  Improves Afform edit screen by adding a link to "View Page".

 ([19691](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19691))**

  If the user has permission to edit the Afform form (and the afform_admin
  extension is enabled), shows a breadcrumb back to edit the form.

- **Afform - Remove ngRoute from afformStandalone page
 ([19703](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19703))**

  Removes an unused dependency from the Afform standalone page, making it

  [19709](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19709))**

  Sites using search kit will rapidly start to accumulate a large number of saved
  searches and will want better filtering (& cleanup). This adds created_id and
  modified_id and starts populating them as well as expires_date (which won't
  start populating until it is exposed in the search kit UI).

- **afform_mock - Hide extension. Clearly indicate as development-only
  ([19541](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19541))**

  Hides the afform_mock extensio and clearly indicates it as development-only.

- **Afform - Support date range filters for search displays
  ([19632](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19632))**

  Adds support for date range filters for Afform search displays.

- **Afform - Allow public submission (PUB-CONTACT). Expand E2E test coverage.
  ([19579](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19579))**

  Makes it possible to submit new contact records to Afform as an anonymous
  user, and includes E2E test-coverage to that effect.

- **Afform - SearchKit support for calculated fields
  ([19612](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19612))**

  Adds support for calculated fields as afform search filters.

- **Search kit select current user
  ([19620](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19620))**

  Adds the ability to choose "Current User" for search criteria which allows
  displays to show different results to different users.

- **Search Kit - Use wrapper api to run searches
  ([19585](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19585))**

  Adds a new `SearchDisplay.Run` api action to centralize the logic and
  permissions for retrieving results for search displays.

- **SearchKit - Enable links for implicit joins
  ([19631](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19631))**

  Improves SearchKit to show links for implicitly joined entities.

- **SearchKit - cleanup display configuration and add "rewrite" feature
  ([19662](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19662))**

  Adds the ability to rewrite fields in search displays, while streamlining the
  display administration screen.

- **SearchKit - Take search filters from the url when viewing a standalone
  display ([19713](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19713))**

  Passes all query params from the url fragment as search filters to
  the display.

- **SearchKit - Add links/menus/buttons to search displays
  ([19673](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19673))**

  Gives the ability to configure sets of links, buttons or menus in SearchKit
  search displays.

- **SearchKit - Add implicit joins for displaying labels of related entities
  ([19554](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19554))**

  Gives SearchKit the ability to display labels of related entities, for
  example, displaying the Campaign title instead of just the Campaign ID.

- **SearchKit - Add links to view multi-record custom data
  ([19626](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19626))**

  When creating a search display, you can now add a link to view a Multi-Record
  custom entity.

- **APIv4 - Add option lists to getFields html_type and data_type
  ([19596](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19596))**

  Adds option lists to html_type and data_type in APIv4 getFields to make them
  easier to discover in the API Explorer.

- **Add is empty filter to search / api
  ([19736](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19736))**

  Adds 2 new operators, "Is Empty" & "Not Empty" to SearchKit (and APIv4 in
  general). Removes the "Is Null / Not Null" operators from SearchKit because
  they are overly technical and have confusingly similar names to the new
  operators (they are still available in the API generally, just not the SearchKit
  UI).

- **Improve search display filter validation
  ([19720](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19720))**

  When viewing a SearchDisplay, this will verify all filters are permitted by
  first checking the SELECT clause, and secondly checking for a containing Afform
  with exposed filters.

- **AuthX - Extended authentication support (portable and router-friendly)
  ([19590](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19590))**

  Introduces an extension, authx, which broadly improves
  support for HTTP authentication on any CiviCRM route.

- **info.xml - Allow multiple `<author>`s
  ([19684](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19684))**

  Allows info.xml files to list multiple authors.

- **APIv3 - Improve array-based apis to support sorting and operators
  ([19690](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19690))**

  Backports some APIv4 code to v3, for the purpose of supporting entityRef
  widgets for Afform.

- **Metadata: Add html:label for Contribution Status ID
  ([19669](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19669))**

  Adds html:label for Contribution Status ID to the metadata.

- **APIv4 explorer, search kit - entity reference fields tricky if you know the
  id ([dev/core#2400](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2400):
  [19638](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19638))**

  Ensures when the user types an integer into an EntityRef field, the record
  with that ID is returned first.

- **Enable-"Do-no-trade"-filter
  ([19650](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19650))**

  Adds a Do not trade filter.

### CiviCase

- **Investigate replacing civicase views with something that is not views (Add
  test for [dev/core#2385](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2385):
  [19609](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19609))**

  Adds test coverage for getCaseActivityQuery.

### CiviContribute

  ([dev/core#2365](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2365):
  [19544](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19544))**

  Speeds up rendering of contribution dashboard charts.

### Joomla Integration

  ([56](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/pull/56))**

  Changes some hardcoded english strings to use the Joomla translation system
  so users can create translation overrides.

## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

### Core CiviCRM

- **Ensure dispatcher has loaded listeners
  ([19614](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19614))**

  Fixes an edge case where the dispatcher can fail to load listeners

- **Correct sms numbers
  ([19509](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19509))**

  When sending SMS messages to contacts in search results, under some
  conditions a single contact's mobile phone number is repeated over and over
  again for remaining contacts.

- **Asset building breaks the site (Work towards
  [dev/core#2137](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2137):
  [19559](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19559) and
  [18830](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18830))**

  Enhances log messages when AssetBuilder fails and put it inside a try/catch.

- **documentation on CIVICRM_CRED_KEYS (Work Towards
  [dev/core#2370](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2370):
  [19568](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19568))**

  Slightly expands the amount of entropy for certain auto-generated values.

- **Prevent double clicking submit button
  ([dev/core#2372](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2372):
  [19610](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19610))**

  Prevents double clicking of submit button on any standard form without ajax
  (ex: New Contribution Form).

- **Geocoding saves values that web UI doesn't accept (Work Towards
  [dev/core#2379](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2379):
  [19588](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19588))**

  The CiviCRM UI doesn't allow saving more than 14 characters in a geocoding
  field. However, geocoders themselves aren't restricted to 14 characters. This
  means that geocoders can enter a geocode that prevents editing the address.

- **Afform permissions - open access didn't seem to work (search kit)
  ([dev/core#2404](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2404):
  [19657](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19657))**

  Addresses some ambiguities/confusion in permission for Afform. The basic
  question -- if permission is omitted (in various ways -- unset, null,
  empty-string), then what is the effective permission?

- **Navigation menu order
  ([dev/core#2424](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2424):
  [19671](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19671))**

  Ensures one can change the order of navigation items from an extension.

- **Create followup section at bottom of non-bulk email activities crashes
  ([dev/core#2473](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2473):
  [19874](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19874))**

  Prevents a crash when the assignee is left blank when creating followup on
  email activity.

- **Afform - Show breadcrumbs appropriate to whether a form can be edited
  ([19739](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19739))**

  Removes the "Edit" link from non-editable forms, and adds the current
  form back into the breadcrumbs, for the sake of forms which use url params for
  routing.

- **APIv4 - Improve handling of joins & custom fields
  ([19562](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19562))**

  Fixes some apparent bugs in SearchKit where certain fields were apparently
  supported in the UI but the API would crash when trying to query them.

- **APIv4 - Increase alias max length to 256
  ([19537](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19537))**

  Fixes a bug in Search Kit where fields derived from long complex joins would
  disappear because their alias was longer than the default length of 63 output
  by CRM_Utils_String::munge().

- **GuzzleMiddleware::url() - Distinguish frontend and backend routes
  ([19678](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19678))**

  GuzzleMiddlware::url() is a helper that simplifies writing URLs within
  Guzzle-based tests. For example, $http->get('route://civicrm/dashboard') send
  a GET request to the local site's civicrm/dashboard page.

- **Cannot create proper `Group`s on multilingual with MySQL 5.6 and Civi
  5.31-rc

- **CiviCRM Find and Merge Duplicate Contacts, does not validate the weight and
  weight threshold, possible to set a weight threshold which can never be
  achieved. ([dev/core#2309](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2309):
  [19604](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19604))**
