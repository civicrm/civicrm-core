### Core CiviCRM

- **Field Names now Reserved Words in MySQL8
  ([dev/core#1143](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1143),
  [dev/core#1144](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1144) and
  [dev/core#1480](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1480):
  [16179](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16179) and
  [16182](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16182))**

  Allows CiviCRM installations to run on MySQL8 and updates the test
  infastructure to support MySQL8.

- **Add controlField metadata for ChainSelect fields
  ([16164](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16164))**

  Adds additional field metadata for state/province and county address fields
  for the sake of autogenerated forms (afform).

- **Allow Angular modules to provide dynamic HTML snippets
  ([16078](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16078))**

  Supports afforms dynamic templates by allowing angular partials to be passed
  as strings not just file paths.

- **Allow values to be passed to api4 GetFields
  ([16154](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16154) and
  [16162](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16162))**

  Makes it possible to filter api4 `getFields` calls by contact
  type, only returning custom fields appropriate to certain contact types.

- **Pass api4 getFields values through to getOptions
  ([16168](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16168))**

  Allows option filtering in api4, similar to how it works in api3.

- **Add api to check for missing indices
  ([16145](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16145))**

  Adds an api to check for missing mysql indices.

  [16141](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16141) and
  [16067](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16067))**

  Work towards throwing exceptions (instead of fatal errors).

- **Deadlocked queries cause an instant error for end-users, but are retried in
  other circumstances (Work Towards
  [dev/core#395](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/395):
  [275](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/pull/275) and
  [16143](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16143))**

  Improves logging from deadlocks specifically, before this change an error
  recorded because of a deadlock query was recorded as "DBError::Unknown Error"
  now they are recorded as "DBError::deadlock".

### CiviContribute

- **We should give user feedback in case of a Payment Processor Exception
  ([15676](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15676))**

### Core CiviCRM

- **CIVI-SA-2019-21 may lead to regressions when following typehints on
  CRM_Core_BAO_Setting::setItem()
  ([dev/core#1425](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1425):
  [15975](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15975))**

  [16144](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16144))**

  Adds an index to the `civicrm_acl_cache.modified_date` column to reduce

- **Api4 - Fix auto serialize array input for CheckBox/MultiSelect fields
  ([16152](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16152))**

  In Api4, serialized fields should input/output as array data. This wasn't
  working on the input side for custom entities. This fixes array input handling
  and adds test coverage.

  ([16130](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16130))**

  Ensures api4 explorer displays output with html entities properly.

  Ensures the Mailing List group type remains set on the Update Smart Group
  form.

- **loadServices: tighten up file match regex
  ([16377](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16377))**

  Ensures that CiviCRM code living under a path containing the characters 'php'
  does not crash when loading services.

  ([15135](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15135))**

  Ensures if an activity is linked to a case the "case activity" actions are
  displayed instead of the standard activity actions (eg. move/copy to case
  instead of file on case).

- **Activity Details CiviReport gives network error when paging to next page if
  choose filter to include case activities
  ([dev/core#1552](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1552):

  criteria ([dev/core#1422](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1422):
  [16038](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16038))**

  Fixes a javascript error "Uncaught ReferenceError" when choosing a membership

### Drupal Integration

- **Error when creating user record for Civi contact

### Wordpress Integration

- **Fix basepage title for Yoast SEO when theme declares "title-tag" support
  ([174](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/174))**

  Fixes a bug for sites with the Yoast SEO plugin where the CiviCRM page title
  was not being displayed properly. Specifically the Yoast SEO plugin
  short-circuits the code in `wp_get_document_title()` by filtering via
  `pre_get_document_title`. This means that the CiviCRM code to apply the
  CiviCRM basepage title via the document_title_parts filter is never reached
  and the basepage title does not reflect the CiviCRM content.
