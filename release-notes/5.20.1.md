## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviMember_: Fix incorrect saving of relational memberships ([dev/membership#21](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/membership/issues/21): [#16407](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16047))**

  This resolves a regression where a membership paid by a different contact
  would end up transferring to the that other contact.

* **_Upgrade_: Fix crash when `pre`/`post` hooks run during upgrade ([dev/core#1449](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1449): [#16034](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16034))**
