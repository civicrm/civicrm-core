## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_WordPress_: Fix hyperlinks between Civi and WP backends ([dev/core#1637](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1637): [#16713](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16713), [#16735](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16735))**

  __Aside__: The fix entails a subtle change to normalize the behavior of an internal API (`Civi::paths()->getUrl()`) when handling a previously undocumented special case (`[variable]/.` expressions).

* **_Smart Groups_: Fix new warning about certain smart groups ([dev/core#1636](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1636): [#16707](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16707))**
