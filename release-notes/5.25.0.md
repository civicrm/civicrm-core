- **Migrate database tables from utf8 to utf8mb4 character set
  ([13633](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13633))**

  This change allows 4-byte characters such as emoji and kanji to be supported
  by CiviCRM.  MySQL 5.7 should not require any configuration changes.  On
  MySQL 5.5 and MySQL 5.6, the following configuration directives **must** be
  applied to your MySQL server, or the upgrade will fail with a fatal error:

    * innodb_large_prefix=true
    * innodb_file_format=barracuda
    * innodb_file_per_table=true

  If these settings are not present, a warning message will be displayed at the
  start of the upgrade process.  If the upgrade fails, you will need to restore
  a backup, fix your MySQL server configuration, and retry the upgrade.

  Any tables in your CiviCRM database named civicrm_* as well as any tables in
  your CiviCRM logging database named log_civicrm_* (e.g. those belonging to
  extensions and custom tables) will be migrated from utf8 to utf8mb4.  This is
  a lossless and reversible migration.
