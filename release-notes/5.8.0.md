## <a name="features"></a>Features

### Core CiviCRM

- **Configurable quicksearch settings
  ([13039](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13039) and
  [13056](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13056))**

  This permits (some) custom fields to be added to quicksearch as searchable
  fields. By adding a setting in Search Preferences to configure the search
  fields in the quicksearch box in the menu bar.

- **Permit additional (freeform) relative date filters - e.g 'last 18 months',
  'last 45 days' ([12682](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12682))**

  This change adds support for a greater range of date options for relative
  searches (e.g last 45 days, last 18 months). It requires option values to be
  added by an extension or by an experienced admin, and has a limited UI.

- **Allow contribution search by recurring payment processor ID / Transaction ID
  ([12818](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12818))**

  This change adds three new fields to the contribution search form: recurring
  contribution transaction ID, payment processor ID and processor ID.

- **[dev/core#495](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/495) Migrate simple
  Preferences & Settings forms to using a Generic class.
  [13054](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13054),
  [13062](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13062),
  [13047](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13047),
  [13046](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13046),
  [13048](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13048),
  [13040](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13040),
  [13004](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13004),
  [13026](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13026),
  [13027](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13027),
  [13025](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13025),
  [12731](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12731),
  [12940](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12940),
  [13022](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13022),
  [13023](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13023),
  [12906](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12906),
  [12919](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12919),
  [12925](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12925) and
  [12960](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12960)**

  Introduce generic settings form (fully metadata driven) - this provides a
  supported methodology for extensions to add settings forms and to alter core
  settings forms (albeit not all core forms are converted to that point).

- **Add icons to contact summary tabs
  ([13018](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13018))**

  This change makes it so that an extension using hook_civicrm_tabset can
  specify icons for the contact summary tabs. If no icon is specified
  fa-puzzle-piece is used.

- **Extract selectedChild tabheader functionality and enable for Manage Events
  ([12747](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12747))**

  This takes the existing functionality of adding "selectedChild=" to a url for
  a tabbed page and makes it work across all the pages tabs. The tab will have
  an id of 'tab-x' where x is the thing to use after '='.

  This change adds the ability to link to a specific tab for an event (and
  generally cleans up the code related to linking to tabs).

- **Fix search performance issues and reliability on some characters issues by
  removing lower case double-conversion
  ([12494](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12494),
  [13035](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13035),
  [13034](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13034),
  [12993](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12993),
  [12987](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12987),
  [12988](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12988),
  [12991](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12991),
  [13053](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13053) and
  [13055](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13055))**

  These changes make performance improvements to searching by moving from using
  the php strtolower function and mysql LOWER function to mysql handling
  comparing strings in a non case specific way.

- **[dev/core#6](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/6) Add help text for
  "is public" setting on form to edit custom field sets
  ([13060](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13060))**

   This change improves user experience of the form to edit custom field sets by
   adding help text to the field "Is this Custom Data Set public?".

- **[dev/core#463](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/463) Add in support
  for Extension Utils when generating DAO files for Extensions
  ([12986](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12986))**

  When creating a new entity (e.g DiscountItem) via an extension the new entity
  will need a DAO class. Our Civix code currently supports this - at least
  somewhat - but will not wrap any translatable strings with ts rather than the
  (correct for extensions) E::ts . Adding this to core will allow civix to
  leverage it to better create extension DAO objects.

- **Continue ongoing work to replace jcalendar with datepicker widget - event
  search form search to datepicker and cleanup template
  ([12978](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12978)) and participant
  registration form
  ([12979](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12979)) and manage
  events fees page ([12977](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12977))
  and manage events registration page
  ([12975](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12975)) and relationship
  form ([12972](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12972)) and event
  fees page ([12992](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12992)) and
  Update subscription form
  ([12868](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12868))***

  These changes move date picking fields from using jcalendar to use the
  datepicker widget in the following places: Event Search form, Participant
  Registration Form, Manage Event Fees Page, Manage Events Registration page,
  Relationships form, Event Fees page and the Update Subscription form.

- **[dev/core#472](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/472) Allow for
  CiviCRM APIv3 Explorer to find API Examples in extensions in the format of
  api/v3/examples/Entity just in the same format as core
  ([13006](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13006))**

  This change makes it so that APIv3 Explorer displays examples found in
  extensions.

- **Translate description in DAO files
  ([13005](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13005))**

  This change makes it so that the Description field in the DAO is translated so
  that if the getfields api returns the translated string.

- **Replace translation and calendar image icons
  ([13003](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13003))**

  This change makes it so that translation and calendar symbols use font
  icons instead of images.

- **[dev/core#457](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/457) Add new hook
  exportIds ([12957](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12957))**

  This change extends CRM_Utils_Hook::export($exportTempTable, $headerRows,
  $sqlColumns, $exportMode, $componentTable, $ids); so that it can return id
  columns.

- **CRM_Core_Resources - Allow container to swap the implementation
  ([12959](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12959))**

  This change makes it so that CRM_Core_Resources can be modified in an
  extension using the hook hook_civicrm_container.

- **Do not treat an empty array as not set in caches.
  ([12784](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12784))**

  This change improves performance by respecting empty arrays as a cache hit.

- **Fix typo in hook that enables links to be added to a block
  ([12913](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12913))**

  This change fixes the $op sent to hook_civicrm_links($op, $objectName,
  $objectId, &$links, &$mask, &$values) from CRM_Core_Block to accept
  create.new.shortcuts in addition to create.new.shorcuts (the misspelled op
  name before this change).

- **Send an 500 http response code when an exception is encountered.
  ([11821](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11821) and
  [12902](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12902))**

  This change makes it so that instead of always exiting with a 200 code, When
  CRM_Utils_System is called with a status > 0, CiviCRM exits with a 500 code.

- **Register "short" and "long" cache services
  ([12873](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12873))**

  This change makes it so that extension developers can use Civi::cache('short')
  or Civi::cache('default') for a short-lived/latency-optimized PSR-16 cache or
  Civi::cache('long') for a long-lived/durability-optimized PSR-16 cache before
  this change only Civi::cache('default') was available.

- **Remove crm.admin.js
  ([12884](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12884))**

  This change is both a performance improvement (removes an unnecessary
  javascript file) and a ui improvement because it improved the icon picker ui.

- **Style improvement of radio form elements
  ([12736](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12736))**

  This change adds more space between radio form elements and their labels.

- **Use description from schema if available when using entityForm
  ([12971](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12971))**

  This change adds the ability to show the description from the entity schema
  instead of hardcoding it in the class when using entityForm.

- **On reports make current employer available as a field for display
  ([12904](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12904))**

  This change makes it so that the field "Current Employer" is available as a
  column on reports.

  menubar plugin with something responsive
  ([13804](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13084)) (preliminary
  work)**

  This makes some behind-the-scenes changes in order to support a new
  [SmartMenus-based menu extension](https://github.com/aydun/uk.squiffle.kam)
  that is anticipated to replace the current menu in core.

- **[dev/financial#33](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/33) Proposal -
  Add in hook alterPostIpn or similar
  ([12928](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12928))**

  This change adds a hook alterIPNData which allows extension authors the ability
  to do custom processing on IPNs such as sending google analytics information
  based on the IPN data.

- **Show contact name on recurring contribution view and improve consistency
  with Contribution/Membership view
  ([12819](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12819))**

  View Participant page and Contribution page regardless of which currency was
  used so that the currency used to make the payment is displayed always.

  ([12897](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12897))**

  This fixes a bug where searching on the "activity result" field (available
  when using CiviCampaign) would result in no results, so that one can search on
  the "activity result" field.

### CiviCase

- **Activities can be linked to multiple cases. Handle caseIds being an array
  ([13021](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13021))**

  This change makes it so that an Activity can be linked to more than one case.

### CiviContribute

- **[CRM-21311](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21311) Fix
  CIVICRM-668 Credit card type is unset on submission causing credit card
  payment to fail with CVV validation error message
  ([12615](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12615))**

  This change fixes a bug where if one changes the default credit card name for
  a Credit card, for example "Amex" to "American Express" then one cannot create
  a contribution with that credit card type so that one can alter the credit
  card names without breaking contributioning with them.

- **[dev/financial#23](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/23)
  Submitting a contribution page with 0 amount triggers PHP notices
  ([12926](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12926))**

  This change removes an e-notice when submitting a contribution page with a 0
  transaction amount.

- **[dev/core#491](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/491) Report results
  don't show inactive campaigns
  ([13036](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13036))**

  This change makes it so that inactive campaigns show up on the Contribution
  Details Report.

- **[dev/core#479](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/479) Contribution
  Summary report throw DB error with custom data and soft credit fields
  ([13017](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13017))**

  This change fixes a bug in the Contribution Summary Report where using a soft
  credit amount stats column and a filter on any custom field would result in a
  DB error so that the report runs as expected.

- **[dev/core#526](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/526) Feedback cannot
  be translated when saving Contribution Page forms in languages other than
  English ([13108](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13108))**

- **[dev/core#534](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/534) Print Invoice
  and Pay Now buttons do not appear on Contact Dashboard
  ([13131](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13131) and
  [13137](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13137))**

- **Fix check for financial acls to look for setting rather than sub-key of
  non-standard civicontribute_settings' setting
  ([13150](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13150))**

- **[dev/core#552](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/552) Contribution net
  amount not re-calculated when fee amount is changed
  ([13177](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13177) and [13178](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13178))**

### CiviEvent

- **Prevent hard error when a string is too long for a field.
  ([13014](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13014))**

  This change fixes a bug where if an event registration's source field was too
  long for the database, the event registration would fail, so that the source
  field is truncated so that it can be saved to the database.

- **Fix caching issues with Event permissions
  ([12769](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12769))**

  This change fixes a bug when checking permissions for events where the
  permissions for the first event were being cached and all subsequent events
  were returned as having no permission regardless of what their permissions
  were.

- **Fix payment hangs when registering a user for a paid event without recording
  payment ([12914](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12914))**

  This fixes a bug where registering a user on the back end for a paid event
  without recording a payment would result in the payment hanging so that it
  does not hang.

- **Replace deprecated event function
  ([13093](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13093))**

- **Fix links for tabs on manage event
  ([13172](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13172))**

### CiviMail

- **[dev/core#461](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/461) Duplicate
  Message template is generated when it is saved through schedule reminder form
  ([12982](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12982))**

  This change fixes a bug where saving a message thru the schedule reminder form
  would result in duplicate message templates being created so that the message
  template is only saved once.

- **[CRM-19751](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-19751) Once "multiple
  bulk" setting, cannot search for opt out or on hold contacts
  ([12883](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12883))**

  This begins work to fix a bug for CiviCRM Instances that have the CiviMail
  setting "Enable multiple bulk email address for a contact" enabled where
  searching for contacts using the criteria "Opt Out" or "On Hold" is filtering
  incorrectly.

- **[dev/core#448](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/448) When creating a
  CiviCRM Mailing including a Smart Group, All contacts met by the criteria of
  the smart group are added. There is no check performed to make sure that
  contacts removed from the smart group aren't included
  ([12945](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12945))**

  This change ensures that when creating a CiviCRM Mailing including a Smart
  Group users who have previously un-subscribed from that Smart Group are not
  included.

- **[dev/core#443](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/443) Fix Non-static
  method calls at CRM_Utils_Mail_Incoming class
  ([12934](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12934))**

  This change fixes a strict warning thrown by CRM_Utils_Mail_Incoming for users
  with a PHP 7.1 set up.

- **[dev/mail#26](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/mail/issues/26) getRecipients()
  appears to use a WHERE clause as an ORDER BY clause
  ([12765](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12765))**

  This change fixes a bug where the order_by for the list of recipients for a
  mailing was being ignored so that the order by is respected.

- **[dev/core#357](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/357) Email signature
  stopped working since ??? 4.6 ??
  ([12828](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12828))**

  This change fixes the Email signature functionality when sending an email.

- **[dev/core#394](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/394) Wildcards are
  ignored in some smart group criteria, when the smart group is directly
  generated for a mailing
  ([12910](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12910))**

  This change ensures that wildcards (like %a%) are respected in smart group
  criteria when a smart group is being generated for a mailing.

- **[dev/core#384](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/384) Mobile phone
  number selection issues with SMS
  ([12890](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12890))**

  This change makes it so one can send SMS using CiviSMS to non primary phones
  of type "mobile".

### CiviMember

- **[dev/core#166](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/166)
  updateAllMemberships in memberschip BAO crasches out of memory on large
  numbers of members
  ([12306](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12306),
  [12927](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12927) and
  [12918](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12918))**

  These changes fix a bug where for databases with large numbers of memberships
  (the user who reported this problem had 1.3 million memberships) the scheduled task to
  update membership statuses was crashing with an out of memory error so that
  databases with large numbers of memberships can run the scheduled task to
  update membership statuses.

- **Fix period_type, duration_unit, duration_frequency to be required on
  membership type form
  ([13227](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13227))**

  These fields had become un-required as a regression in 5.5.

### Drupal Integration

- **Intelligently adjust menubar for D7 toolbar toggle
  ([12937](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12937))**

  This change improves the ui by making the Civi menubar set to 100% minus the
  width of the toolbar toggle, but only if the toolbar toggle is actually
  present on the screen. Before this change the menu was set to a width of 97%
  which was problematic because 97% is a guestimate and some Drupal sites do not
  use the toolbar module.

- **Added a path to the drupal8 path candidates to find civicrm.config.php
  ([12903](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12903))**

  This change fixes a bug when running the civibuild command `Civibuild
  create drup8 --type=drupal8-clean` would result in a fatal error
  "Failed to locate template for civicrm.config.php" so that Civibuild generates
  the installation files and goes to the next step.

- **[CRM-20298](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20298) Drupal Views:
  Custom fields of type Money should use the same filter operators as Integer
  fields ([435](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/435))**

  This change makes it so that in Drupal views, civicrm custom fields of type
  money use the filter operators for Integers (instead of the filter operators
  for text).

- **civicrm_handler_field_link_pcp: avoid PHP notice
  ([547](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/pull/547))**

  This change fixes a php notice thrown by drupal views that use fields that use
  the handler civicrm_handler_field_link_pcp.

### Wordpress Integration

- **[dev/wordpress#12](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/issues/12) A
  civicrm shortcode for a contribution page on the homepage results in a "Too
  many redirects" error instead of the thank you page
  ([13043](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13043))**

  This change fixes a bug where putting a wordpress shortcode on the homepage
  would result in a too many redirect error instead of the thank you page.

- **Allow user-defined shortcode components to be rendered
  ([134](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/134))**

  This change makes it so that Wordpress plugins and CiviCRM Extensions which
  define custom components for the [civicrm] shortcode, shortcodes work.

- **Do not start session when running under WP-CLI
  ([135](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/135))**

  This fixes a bug where when running WP-CLI when the Apache user has
  permissions that the shell user does not would result in a PHP Warning.

- **Fix WP-CLI class for PHP 7.2
  ([133](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/133))**

  This change makes it so one can use WP-CLI in PHP 7.2.

- **[dev/core#460](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/460) Fix malformed
  redirect URLs ([12969](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12969))**

  This change fixes a bug where malformed redirect URLs were being formed for
  Wordpress users on event registration and confirmation pages.

- **[dev/wordpress#12](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/issues/12) A
  civicrm shortcode for a contribution page on the homepage results in a "Too
  many redirects" error instead of the thank you page
  ([13099](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13099))**

  This resolves a problem retrieving URL parameters when the URL is URL-encoded,
  as frequently happens in WordPress.
