## <a name="features"></a>Features

### Core CiviCRM

- **Feature to provide most used countries in top section of Country select
  list ([19025](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19025))**

  A new option for Pinned Countries allows administrators to specify one or more
  commonly-used countries to appear at the top of the select list of countries
  when it appears on forms.

- **Send email to contacts when clicking on their email address on the contact's
  card (Work Towards
  [dev/core#1790](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1790):
  [19082](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19082))**

  This improves user experience by preventing tooltips from closing as long as
  the user's mouse is inside of the tooltip element.

- **Unhide oauth extension
  ([19107](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19107))**

  Makes the Oauth extension available for upgrade on the extensions form.

- **Support utf8mb4 so notes can save Emojis and other good things (Work Towards
  [dev/core#339](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/339):
  [18960](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18960))**

  When installing CiviCRM, this makes it so mysql tables are created as
  utf8mb4 instead of utf8 by default.

- **crm-ui-debug - If in debug mode, then load pretty-printer for JSON data
  ([18994](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18994))**

  Improves debugging experience on AngularJS-based pages by printing debug data
  formatted nicely instead of as a large text blob.

- **afform_html - Include Monaco dependencies
  ([dev/core#2197](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2197):
  [18988](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18988))**

  The afform_html extension depends upon the Monaco Editor.  This loads the
  Monaco library as part of core CiviCRM using Composer.

- **API - Finer-grained permissions for the dashboard & dashlet entities
  ([18962](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18962))**

  The API no longer requires the "administer CiviCRM" permission to access
  dashboard records.  Contacts with "access CiviCRM" can read dashboard records
  for contacts they have access to, and write permissions for non-admins are
  restricted to editing only their own dashboard.

- **Improve APIv4 metadata for RelationshipCache and Bridge entities in general
  ([19101](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19101))**

  Core changes needed so that Search Kit can support joins.

- **Use trait instead of class for Entity Bridges; add OptionList trait
  ([19010](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19010))**

  Improves APIv4 categorization of entities, which is then used to improve the
  Search Kit UI.

- **Improve schema metadata for Search Kit
  ([19075](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19075))**

  Improves the relevance of entities listed in Search Kit by only displaying
  entities designated as searchable.

- **Search kit joins
  ([19150](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19150) and
  [19105](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19105))**

  Adds support for multiple and multi-layered joins in Search Kit.

- **Afform - Update fields and HTML mode in web-based editors
  ([19053](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19053))**

  Improves Afform administration screens by adding descriptions for the inputs
  and a way to view/edit the HTML formulation.

- **Afform - Generate dashlets based on `Afform.is_dashlet` property.
  ([19005](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19005))**

  Makes it easier to expose a custom form on the CiviCRM dashboard by making it
  so each Afform can be flagged with is_dashlet=1; when toggled, it will
  register or unregister the dashlet.

- **Update Resource URL Helptext
  ([19046](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19046))**

  Updates Resource URL field help text to accurately reflect today's best
  practice.

- **Improve bootstrap3 checkbox theming
  ([19006](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19006))**

  Adds some reusable styling for check boxes in Bootstrap.

- **changes social media iframes/scripts to links, simplifies markup, adds email
  & bootstrap classes
  ([18880](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18880))**

  Improves the display of the "Help Spread the word" section for sites using the
  standard theme (Greenwich).

- **Add standard Contact fields to the Bookkeeping report template
  ([19008](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19008))**

  Improves the Bookkeeping report template by adding standard contact fields.

- **Allow Angular modules to require Resource bundles
  ([18987](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18987))**

  Permits Angular modules to require "bundles" from Civi::Resources.

- **Extensions UI tweak
  ([18981](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18981))**

  The subheader for extensions in the listing is now the description rather than
  the key.  The details in the expanded listing are also reordered.

### CiviContribute

- **Cancel first contribution associated to membership, cancels the
  membership (Work Towards
  [dev/core#927](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/927):
  [19012](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19012)
  [19014](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19014) and
  [19015](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19015))**

  Extends the contributioncancelactions extension to also work for Failed
  contributions, cleans up related code and adds a test.

- **Deprecate BaseIPN functions validateData & LoadObject
  (Work Towards [dev/financial#148](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/-/issues/148):
  [19033](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19033),

  [18947](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18947) and
  [19043](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19043))**

  Work towards simplifying the CiviContribute code.

- **Remove detail about updating related components when editing a
  contribution status
  ([dev/core#2158](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2158):
  [18961](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18961))**

  Removes some details from the message when editing a contribution status which
  improves performance.

### CiviGrant

- **Add Grant v4 api
  ([19020](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19020))**

  Makes the Grant entity available in APIv4.

### CiviMember

- **Remove 'onlinePendingContribution' payment support from membership edit form
  ([dev/core#2155](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2155):
  [18964](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/18964))**

  Removes "Update Payment Status" checkbox from Membership Edit Form to improve
  user experience by simplifying the UI.

### WordPress Integration

  ([dev/wordpress#63](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/wordpress/-/issues/63):
  [19058](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/19058) and
  [226](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/226))**

  Improves the PCP short code by adding an action parameter for which the options
  are "info" and "transact". When the action parameter is set to "info" the page
  displays the PCP info page, when it is set as "transact" the page displays the
  relevant PCP contribution form.
