## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviGrant_: Custom statuses renamed during migration ([dev/core#3161](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3161): [#23130](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23130), [#23140](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23140))**

  CiviGrant supports configurable statuses ("Administer => CiviGrant => Grant Status").  If one of the _default statuses_ was
  _modified_, then the status could have reverted to its default name.

  This fix prevents similar problems in new upgrades.  However, if you previously used an affected version (5.47.0-5.48.0),
  then please review the list in "Administer => CiviGrant => Grant Status".

* **_CiviMail_: Fix validation error on sites that do not use Flexmailer ([#23141](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23141))**
* **_Upgrader_: Fix "No such table" error for web-user who navigates toward upgrade screen ([dev/core#3166](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3166): [#23148](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23148))**
