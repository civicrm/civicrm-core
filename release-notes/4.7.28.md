### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-16243](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-16243) Dependency
  management for extensions
  ([11173](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11173) and
  [11101](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11101))**

  Extensions can now specify other extensions they depend on.  When enabling an
  extension, the requisite extensions will be automatically enabled first.
  However, for now at least, this does not automatically download those
  extensions.

- **[CRM-20769](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20769) Allow for
  Button Text on profiles to be overriden in settings
  ([10557](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10557))**

  You can now enter custom labels for the Save and Cancel buttons on profiles in
  Create or Edit modes.

- **[CRM-21322](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21322) create hook to
  modify entityRef fields
  ([11192](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11192))**

  A [new
  hook](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/hooks/hook_civicrm_alterEntityRefParams/)
  allows extension developers to modify the parameters for entity reference
  fields that appear in a form.

- **[CRM-21195](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21195) Adding the
  ability to add icons to menu items
  ([11054](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11054)) (follow-up work)**

  This offers a slight adjustment to the markup for menu item icons.

- **[CRM-21262](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21262) Add a check
  for incorrect Resource URL
  ([11067](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11067))**

  A message will now appear on the Status Report if a site's CiviCRM Resource
  URL is set incorrectly.

- **[CRM-20903](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20903) Improve
  ordering of dedupe rules
  ([11109](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11109) and
  [11098](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11098))**

  Duplicate matching rules are now displayed in a consistent order: first the
  supervised and unsupervised rules, and then the general use rules in
  alphabetical order by title.

- **[CRM-20304](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20304) Add option to
  alphabetize option values
  ([11045](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11045))**

  Custom field options can now be alphabetized in one click.

- **[CRM-21179](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21179) Dashlet -
  Charts ([11005](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11005))
  (preliminary work)**

  CiviCRM now ships with the dc.js, d3.js, and crossfilter.js libraries.  These
  historically have been provided by the Civisualize extension, but they are now
  available for report developers who don't want the full set of Civisualize
  features.

- **[CRM-21122](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21122) Support
  selection of smart groups on Contact Dashboard
  ([10925](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10925))**

  Smart Groups with Public Pages visibility are now available for users to join
  them through the User Dashboard.

- **[CRM-21379](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21379) Fix Activity
  dashlet issues ([11221](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11221))**

  The Activities dashlet now has the option to display all activities regardless
  of status.  The default is the legacy behavior of only displaying scheduled
  activities.  Legacy users should note that the default order is reversed, with
  the newest activities displayed first.

### CiviCase

- **[CRM-20078](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20078) Activity card -
  General ([11159](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11159))**

  The "File on case" button is improved so that it does not appear when an
  activity is being viewed in the context of a case.  In addition, when using
  "File on case", the case defaults to an open case for the activity target
  contact if one is available.

### CiviContribute

- **[CRM-20868](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20868),
  [CRM-21480](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21480), and
  [CRM-21479](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21479) set
  invoice_number at contribution->create, not invoice creation
  ([10681](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10681),
  [11341](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11341), and
  [11321](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11321))**

  Every contribution now comes with an invoice number regardless of whether an
  invoice has been generated.

- **[CRM-21354](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21354) Allow
  "Advanced Search" to search for recurring contribution status
  ([11080](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11080))**

  Recurring contribution status is now searchable in Advanced Search.

- **[CRM-21346](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21346) Make pledge
  installment count & amount exportable
  ([11194](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11194))**

  The number of installments and original installment amount fields for pledges
  are now exportable from the pledge search.

- **[CRM-21287](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21287) Add Financial
  Type to "Contributions by Household" report
  ([11106](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11106))**

  The "Contributions by Household" report now has the option to display and/or
  filter by financial type.

### CiviMail

- **[CRM-20919](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20919) Adjust
  Mailing.create api for creating Completed mailings
  ([10707](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10707))**

  Completed mailings can now be imported via the API.

- **[CRM-21231](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21231) On CiviMail
  screen make 'Review and Schedule' tab active if required fields are filled
  ([11035](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11035))**

  When composing a message in CiviMail, the second tab, "Review and Schedule",
  is disabled at first.  Now, the tab link becomes active when the first tab is
  complete.

- **[CRM-21282](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21282) Improve
  ordering of CiviMail click reporting
  ([11099](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11099))**

  The click report summary now orders links by the descending number of clicks.

### Drupal Integration Modules

- **[CRM-21297](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21297) Automatically
  fill database details in installer for Drupal
  ([11113](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11113))**

  The database connection fields when installing CiviCRM on Drupal now default
  to the CMS database connection details.  This matches the process on
  WordPress.

  The introduction of multilingual columns means that the multilingual schema
  must be rebuilt.  Otherwise, multilingual sites will encounter an error when
  upgrading.

- **[CRM-21363](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21363) and
  [CRM-21455](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21455) Ensure that

  ([11249](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11249),

  is active.
