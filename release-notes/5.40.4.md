## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: Fix line-item total calculation ([dev/financial#182](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/-/issues/182): [#21212](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21212))**

  The total may sometimes incorrectly include tax-amount. This did not impact contributions through core forms but could impact customizations/add-ons that add taxed items via API.

* **_Export_: Fix error when editing SMS-based reminders ([dev/core#2784](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2784): [#21239](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21239))**
* **_Scheduled Reminders_: Work-around to enable reminders when the "Effective Start/End Date" is "0000-00-00 00:00:00". ([dev/core#2787](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2787): [#21250](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/21250))**
