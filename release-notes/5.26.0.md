## NOTICE: WordPress Service URLs

The upcoming release of WordPress 5.5 ([ETA August 2020](https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-5/)) requires changes to several CiviCRM URLs. CiviCRM 5.26+ adopts a new URL convention. For old URLs, there is transitional support that will work for most web-based visitors. However, this may not be sufficient for *external service integrations* (e.g. certain payment processors or email relays which send notifications to CiviCRM).

Administrators should promptly assess and update any external services which submit notifications to their CiviCRM-WordPress sites. For more information, see the blog post [CiviCRM 5.26 and WordPress: Important notice](https://civicrm.org/blog/kcristiano/civicrm-526-and-wordpress-important-notice).

### Core CiviCRM

- **Create nl_BE translation
  ([dev/translation#4](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/translation/issues/4):
  [17048](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17048),
  [17027](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17027) and
  [16966](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16966))**

  Adds a "Dutch (Belgium)" (shorthand: nl_BE) translation of CiviCRM which
  heavily borrows from the existing "Dutch (Netherlands)" (nl_NL) translation
  with a few changes.

- **APIv4 - Allow field options to be returned in multiple formats
  ([17167](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17167))**

  Gives more flexibility about how options are returned from APIv4 and adds
  visibility in the API explorer.

- **APIv4 - How do I interact with option values?
  ([dev/core#1705](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1705):
  [17158](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17158),
  [17138](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17138) and
  [17219](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17219))**

  Adds support for pseudoconstants to APIv4.

- **APIv4 - Add MessageTemplate API
  ([17073](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17073))**

  Adds new "MessageTemplate" entity to APIv4.

- **APIv4 - Add support for HAVING clause
  ([17015](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17015))**

  Adds support for using `HAVING` clauses in APIv4.

- **APIv4 - Query Improvements (Work Towards
  [dev/report#31](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/report/issues/31):
  [17113](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17113) and
  [17047](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17047))**

  This adds UI support for new APIv4 features.  Specifically, SQL functions and
  aliases are now available in the API explorer, as is the `HAVING` clause and
  `GROUP BY` clause.

- **End of life planning for MySQL server 5.0 - 5.6 (Work Towards
  [dev/core#1681](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1681):
  [17261](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17261))**

  Adds a deprecation notice for systems using MySQL versions before 5.7 and
  requires 5.5 to install.

- **Allow inline help text title to be overriden
  ([dev/core#1693](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1693):
  [16998](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16998))**

  This change makes it possible to override inline help text titles in a
  `.hlp.extra` file.

- **Update attachment message on mailing form.
  ([dev/core#1696](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1696):
  [17024](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17024))**

  This updates the help text on CiviMail attachments to specify the maximum size
  of each attachment.

- **Convert CC and BCC fields to use an entity reference.
  ([17064](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17064) and [17129](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17129))**

  The CC and BCC fields on all email forms are now entity references to the
  email ID. This simplifies the code and extends filtering on the field.

- **Introduce "civi.dao.preUpdate" and "civi.dao.preInsert" events
  ([dev/core#1638](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1638):
  [16714](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16714))**

  Makes it possible to use a hook to inspect the data of an Option Value prior
  to it being created or updated.

- **Add ID to custom group/field admin forms
  ([17055](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17055))**

  The ID numbers are displayed in the tables of custom fields and groups.

- **Improve AngularJS performance with one-time binding for static strings
  ([17050](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17050))**

  This improves performance of AngularJS pages and forms by having the
  translation function only execute once when the translated string is static.

- **Allow setting metadata to use the `table` option. Update example setting
  `default_invoice_page`.
  ([16903](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16903))**

  Setting metadata that refers to an entity can now be defined with reference to
  a database table, specifying the key and label columns, rather than requiring
  a pseudoconstant function to populate the options.

- **Add / make fit for purpose email.getlist api call
  ([16993](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16993))**

  Improves the `Email.getlist` API so that it is usable for entity reference
  fields.

### CiviCase

- **Add email link in case summary
  ([16959](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16959))**

  Adds an "Email" icon to the Case Summary page that when clicked opens a pop up
  window to email the client.

### CiviContribute

- **Add contribution source to recurring contribution report
  ([17187](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17187))**

  Adds "Contribution Source" as a column on the Recurring Contribution Report.

- **Show email receipt status on view recurring contribution
  ([17177](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17177))**

  When viewing a contribution this change exposes the value of
  `is_email_receipt`.

- **Add contributor email address to cancelSubscription form so it is clear who
  will be notified
  ([16716](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16716))**

  Adds the contributor email to the Cancel Recurring Contribution form so it is
  clear who will be notified.

- **Add filter and sorting for receipt date in contribution report
  ([17044](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17044) and
  [16994](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16994))**

  Adds a filter and sorting for "receipt date" to Contribution Reports.

- **Capitalise "PAN Truncation"
  ([16973](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16973) and
  [16964](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16964))**

  Capitilizes the "PAN" in "Pan Truncation" to improve user experience. PAN is
  an acronym for Primary Account Number (credit card number).

### CiviMail

- **Mailing Report: hide the HTML preview
  ([16899](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16899))**

  Improves the Mailing report by hiding the HTML preview because it was too
  short to be helpful to begin with.

  [dev/core#1460](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1460):
  [17127](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17127) and
  [17216](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17216))**

  This updates the `CiviEventDispatcher` with a method `setDispatchPolicy()`
  that can be used to dynamically toggle support for specific events/hooks and
  updates a related test.

- **After core upgrade, extensions are not fully active
  ([dev/core#1460](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1460) and
  [dev/core#1713](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1713):
  [17126](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17126))**

  After performing a core upgrade, some extension functionality (e.g. routing) was
  temporariliy unavailable - and required a flush. This fix changes the way in which
  hooks and caches are managed during the upgrade.

- **Report Dev tab display SQL multiple times
  ([dev/core#1673](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1673):

  in one row being exported when the related contact id was selected.

- **Regression: Fails to create smartgroup or refresh count of group
  ([dev/core#1747](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1747):
  [17438](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17438))**

  search was removed too aggressively, resulting in database errors when
  searching or refreshing the smart group count.
