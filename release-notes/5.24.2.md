## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_DB DataObject_: Fix inappropriate SQL rollbacks ([dev/core#1675](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1675), [dev/core#1695](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/1695): [packages#289](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/pull/289), [#17033](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17033))**

  This problem meant that certain forms would *appear* to work - but would
  not actually commit their changes to the database.  It was specifically
  observed in CiviCase when using either (a) "Add timeline" or (b) Drupal
  Webform with CiviCase custom-fields.  However, the problem may have
  affected other (non-CiviCase) scenarios.

* **_Localization_: Fix warnings when using current `l10n` data ([dev/translation#4](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/translation/issues/4): [#16966](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/16966), [#17021](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17021))**
* **_Upgrader_: Fix compatibility with certain extensions ([#17004](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/17004))**
