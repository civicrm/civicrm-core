## <a name="bugs"></a>Bugs resolved

* **_CiviContribute_: Permissioned relationships are not created when paying "On Behalf Of" an organization ([dev/core#3675](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3675): [#23865](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23865))**
* **_Guzzle_: Update to v6.5.8 ([#23858](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23858))**

  This applies a prophylactic security update. It is not believed to impact the security of CiviCRM deployments.

* **_Price Sets_: Currency displayed incorrectly (if default currency is not USD) ([dev/core#3680](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3680): [#23867](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23867))**
* **_Recent Items_: Fix error when running API calls with elevated privileges ([dev/core#3671](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/3671): [#23836](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23836), [#23876](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/23876))**

  This resolves an error in the RecentItems subsystem which could manifest in other subsystems (eg webform_civicrm) when using elevated privileges (eg `checkPermissions=>FALSE`).
