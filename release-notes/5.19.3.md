* **_WordPress_: Fix URL generation in wp-cli ([dev/core#1412](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/1412):
  [#15919](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15919), [#15922](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15922),
  [#15929](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/15929), [#171](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/pull/171))**

  This addresses a regression in which some background tasks - most notably
  CiviMail delivery - generate broken URLs.  The problem only affects
  deployments which use `wp-cli` as the task runner.
