includeRule can be "include" or "exclude".
  include means include the fields listed in the region.
  exclude means include all fields not listed in the region AND not listed in the exclusionCorrespondingRegion.

includeTime is true or false and says whether to include the time component of date fields.
  It can be overridden at the Field level.
  
ifBlank specifies an alternate field to display if the field is blank.

  <!-- The rightpane body then gets "everything that isn't in the header", EXCEPT
    the fields you specify here. This seems a good compromise
    over explicitly having to define which fields we want for each activity type,
    given that they are custom.
    
    One future tweak is to improve the way the fields get ordered here. Right now
    they'll just come out the same order as in the export, which will likely be semi-random.
