-- Fix missing resubscribeUrl token. There doesn't seem to be any precedent
-- for doing an upgrade for these, since the last update was in 2009 when
-- the token went missing and it had no upgrade script for it. Also unlike
-- message templates, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell whether it's
-- been changed. Using ts is a bit unreliable if the translation has changed
-- but it would be no worse than now and just end up not updating it.
-- Also, I'm drawing a blank on why the %3 is replaced differently during
-- install than during upgrade, hence the OR clause.
