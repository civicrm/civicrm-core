    // Should hooks dispatch while applying CiviCRM DB upgrades? The answer is
    // mixed: it depends on the specific hook and the specific upgrade-step.
    //
    // Some example considerations:
    // - If the "log_civicrm_*" tables and triggers are to be reconciled during
    //   the upgrade, then one probably needs access to the list of tables and
    //   triggers defined by extensions. These are provided by hooks.
    // - If a hook fires while the DB has stale schema, and if the hook's logic
    //   has a direct (SQL) or indirect (BAO/API) dependency on the schema, then
    //   the hook is prone to fail. (Ex: CiviCRM 4.x and the migration from
    //   civicrm_domain.config_backend to civicrm_setting.)
    // - If *any* hook from an extension is called, then it may use classes
    //   from the same extension, so the classloader / include-path / hook_config
    //   should be operational.
    // - If there is a general system flush at the end of the upgrade (to rebuild
    //   important data-structures -- routing tables, container cache, metadata
    //   cache, etc), then there's a huge number of hooks that should fire.
    // - When hooks (or variations like "rules") are used to define business-logic,
    //   they probably are not intended to fire during DB upgrade. Then again,
    //   upgrade-logic is usually written with lower-level semantics that avoid firing hooks.
