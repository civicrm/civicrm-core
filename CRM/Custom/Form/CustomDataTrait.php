   * Add custom data fields to the form.

   * This function takes responsibility for registering the appropriate fields with QuickForm.
   *
   * It does not assign variables to the smarty layer to assist with rendering or setDefaults.
   * Those additional steps are not required on the 'main form' when the CustomDataForm is
   * being rendered by ajax as that process takes care of the presentation.
   *
   * However, the fields need to be registered with QuickForm to ensure that on submit
   * they are 'accepted' by quick form. Quick form validates the contents of $_POST
   * and only fields that have been registered make it through to the values
   * available in `$form->getSubmittedValues()`.
   *
   * @param string $entity
   * @param array $filters
   *   Filters is only needed for entities where CustomDataGroups may be filtered.
   *   e.g Activity custom data groups might be available for only some entity types.
   *   In that case the filters would hold the id (if any) of the entity and the
   *   activity_type_id if known.
