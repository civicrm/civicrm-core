/*
 * This file checks and updates the status of all membership records for a given domain using the calc_membership_status and
 * update_contact_membership APIs.
 * It takes the first argument as the domain-id if specified, otherwise takes the domain-id as 1.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * We are using the default Domain FROM Name and FROM Email Address as the From email address for emails sent by this script.
 * Verify that this value has been properly set from Administer > Configure > Domain Information
 * If you want to use some other FROM email address, modify line 125 and set your valid email address.
 *
 * Save the file as UpdateMembershipRecord.php prior to running this script.
