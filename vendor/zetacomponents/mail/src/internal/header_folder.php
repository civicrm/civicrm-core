/**
 * Internal class folding headers according to RFC 2822.
 *
 * RFC 2822 specifies two line length restrictions:
 *
 * "There are two limits that this standard places on the number of
 *  characters in a line. Each line of characters MUST be no more than
 *  998 characters, and SHOULD be no more than 78 characters, excluding
 *  the CRLF."
 *
 * The 76 character limit is because of readability. The 998 character limit
 * is a result of SMTP limitations.
 *
 * The rule for folding is:
 * "wherever this standard allows for folding white space (not
 *  simply WSP characters), a CRLF may be inserted before any WSP."
 *
 * This is described in more detail in section 3.2.3.
