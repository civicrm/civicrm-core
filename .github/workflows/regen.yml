# Helper to run bin/regen.sh to regenerate civicrm_generated.mysql
# 1. In your civicrm-core fork on github.com, click on the Actions tab.
#   * If you don't see an Actions tab, you may need to enable Github Actions in your fork, under Settings - Actions - General.
# 2. Click on Regen on the left.
#   * If you don't see Regen on the left, the master branch of your fork may be outdated. In a recent git checkout of master run `git push my-fork master`, where "my-fork" is the remote alias of your fork (see output of `git remote -v`).
# 3. On the right you'll see a dropdown "Run workflow".
# 4. From the Branch field in the dropdown pick your branch.
# 5. Optionally choose to have it add a commit with the new file to your branch at the end, otherwise it will give you the file to download.
#    Note it does not autosquash but typically this would be done at the end and is acceptable as its own commit.
# 6. Wait about 2-3 minutes until the spinning yellow turns green.
# 7. If you didn't choose to commit, then to get to the download click on the green.
# 7. Scroll down to Artifacts.
# 8. There's your file available for download.
