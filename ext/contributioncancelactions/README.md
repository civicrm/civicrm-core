# contributioncancelactions

![Screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

This extension cancels memberships, participation records,
and pledge payments when the related
contribution is cancelled. If you do not wish them to be cancelled
then disable the extension. If you want more complex logic
you may be able to achieve it using civirules or another extension.

This code was part of the core code prior to 5.32 at which point
it was separated to an optional extension.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Requirements

* PHP v7.1+
* CiviCRM 5.32+

## Installation (Web UI)

This extension ships with core - you can enable or disable in the extensions UI.
