You can create additional contact types based on these basic types to further differentiate contacts (for example you might create Student, Parent, Staff, and /or Volunteer "subtypes" from the basic Individual type...). You can also re-name the built-in types. Contact subtypes are especially useful when you need to collect and display different sets of custom data for different types of contacts.') }}
