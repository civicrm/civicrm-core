# iATS CiviCRM Extension 1.6.0

Released May 2, 2017

The primary goal of this release is to provide a 4.7 compatible version of the iATS payment extension for CiviCRM.

If you only use iATS for one-time credit card payments, then you're not likely to see any issues, but otherwise please see below for a number of oustanding and recent issues related to CiviCRM Core. We strongly recommend you remain updated with the latest 4.7.x release.

## 1. https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20401

Cancel/modify URL receipt links are wrong. This affects recurring contributions. 
You can manually edit the message template to fix this.

## 2. https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20387

If you enable Sales Tax and Invoicing, then ACHEFT verification will no longer work for any pending payments on contributions that you issue an invoice for.

This version of the extension includes a patched version of the code (linked to the issue above).

## 3. https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-19508

ACHEFT and SWIPE TPL/fields switching only works when the Payment Processor marked as site default is one of the options on the Contribution/Event form.

ACHEFT by itself only loads the proper TPL/fields if there is a default amount set on the Contribution/Event form.

## 4. https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20396

ACHEFT Event registrations (not affecting Contributions) are marked Completed when first processed - as a Result they will never be verified. They are also marked "Credit Card" by Core instead of "Direct Debit.

A fix has been submitted to core and should be in 4.7.20, but you can apply the fix in this PR if you need it immediately: https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/10124

## 5. UK Direct Debit

We have retired the UK direct debit iATS processor, due to lack of interest and use.

## 6. https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/issues/197

Back-end recurring contributions using future start dates not implemented.
