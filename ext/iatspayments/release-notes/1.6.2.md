# iATS CiviCRM Extension 1.6.2

July 6, 2018

This release is an update to the 1.6.1 (4.7+ compatible version) of the iATS payment extension for CiviCRM, primarily for compatibility with the latest 5.x CiviCRM series, which introduced some non-critical feature breakage as noted in various issues.

Newly added is a slightly modified version of the detailed contribution report that joins it to iATS journal data. This allows administrators to do reconciliation of CiviCRM contributions against transactions reported from iATS.
