# iATS CiviCRM Extension 1.6.1

Oct 17, 2017

This release is an update to the 1.6.0 (4.7 compatible version) of the iATS payment extension for CiviCRM.

## 1. https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/issues/184

This issue may conflate a number of related problems with ACH/EFT verification. In any case, the overall strategy for 
verification of payments has undergone a significant refactoring so that the iATS Journal data is now being stored 
in a raw form locally in CiviCRM, and is available via the CiviCRM reports mechanism.

More notes available here: https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/pull/201
and here: https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/wiki/Verification-and-the-Journal

Longer term, this change sets us up for future work to enable better error handling, iATS-managed recurring contributions, and use of the iATS-hosted (or other system) payment pages.

## 2. https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/issues/197

Back-end recurring contributions using future start dates have been implemented, and a configuration option is 
provided that enables public forms to use this functionality as well.

## 3. Automated Testing

We've started adding automated tests to this extension!
