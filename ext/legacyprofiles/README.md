# legacyprofiles

Re-enables legacy features for profiles, such as:

- Profile field visibility
- Searchable
- Is View

These settings made it possible to use Profiles for listings. However, they can very easily lead to risky configuration errors.

This extension does not have any code at the moment. Core checks to see if the config function exists.

This is an [extension for CiviCRM](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/customize/extensions/), licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Getting Started

To re-enable the legacy features, re-enable this extension.
