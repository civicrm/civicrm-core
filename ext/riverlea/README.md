# RiverLea Theme Framework

This Framework separates CiviCRM's visual/UI CSS from structural CSS, using CSS variables. Installing it provides you with four new Riverlea Themes or "Streams" which are almost entirely created with CSS variables:
 - Minetta, named after the river that runs under Greenwich, NYC. It is based on Civi's default 'Greenwich' theme.
 - Walbrook, named after the river that runs under Shoreditch, London. It is based on Shoreditch/TheIsland theme.
 - Hackney, named after the river that runs under Finsbury Park, based on Finsbury Park theme.
 - Thames, named after the river that runs close to Artful Robot HQ, based on their Aah theme.

When you enable CiviCRM, you will see these themes in your usual CiviCRM theme options on the Display Settings page, where you can also set your dark mode preferences.

## Version numbering
