/*
    Name: Empty stream;
    Description: duplicate this to create a new stream;
    Riverlea version: 1.4.8;
    Some pointers:
      - Use this stream to replace the variables in '/core/css/_variables.css'.
        That's the file to study to understand how RL variables work.
      - All variables are prefixed with '--crm' to avoid clashes with other CMS theme variables.
      - '--crm-c-' denotes a colour, and '--crm-f-' denotes a front-end variable
        that's only applied on '.crm-public'
      - Variables often exist in chains, pointing to each other so that you can both
        have one change applied in multiple areas *and* over-ride that in a specific area.
      - These can run three deep, eg a colour variable ('--crm-c-amber'), is applied to a
        functional colour variable ('--crm-c-warning') that's then used by '--crm-btn-bg-warning'
        and '--crm-notify-warning'
      - All of these are defined in Core Variables, so before replacing in a Stream, decide what your goal is.
      - E.g., if you wanted to change warning colours to pink. you could redefine '--crm-c-amber'
        to point to a pink colour property. But that loses the semantic meaning and maybe there's other
        places that point to amber. It's probably safer to add a variable in your stream '--crm-c-pink'
        that matches your colour, then set '--crm-c-warning: var(--crm-c-pink)'.
      - If you only want warning buttons to change, and not notifications, then you could
        just set '--crm-btn-bg-warning: var(--crm-c-pink)'
      - Good contrast between backgrounds (usually with 'bg' in the variable name) and foreground (usually with 'text') are
        needed for accessibility. So most functional colours exist in pairs: '--crm-c-warning' and '--crm-c-warning-text'.
      - These can be checked with a tool like https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ - with
        4.5:1 ratio needed for WCAG AA and 7:1 for WCAG AAA.
      - '--text' as a foreground colour is normally a black or a white shade, pointing to '--crm-c-text-dark' or '--crm-c-text-light'.
      - This terminology is key for the inversion with dark-mode, when '-crm-c-text' will change from dark to light
        but these two variables text-light/dark stay the same as default.
      - Some colours use 'hsl' processing generate automatically. E.g. 'crm-c-primary-hover' is darker version of any 'crm-c-primary' colour.
        The same with alert-borders. In other words, check core to ensure you need to over-write every colour, if there's an auto colour and it works.
      - 'crm-roundness' for border-radius is used in dozens of places, most of which (inputs, buttons, fieldsets, accordions, notifications, etc)
        can be directly over-ridden with specific variables, e.g. '--crm-input-border-radius'
      - While you can add your own CSS here, it can prevent future updates of Civi and RiverLea updating for your theme.
      - Before adding your own CSS in a civicrm.css file a suggested workflow would be:
          1. use browser inspector to see if the change you want can be handled by a variable.
          2. if that variable is part of a chain, make a note so you decide later if you only want this one instance changed
             or all instances.
          3. if you need to write custom css in a civicrm.css - double check if this is a shortfall of the RiverLea theme - it might be.
             feel free to open an issue on https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/user-interface suggesting missing variables for your use-case.
