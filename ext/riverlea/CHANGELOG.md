1.4.3-6.2alpha
This release makes a series of changes to how emphasis colours (ie primary/success/info/etc) are handled across RiverLea. The main changes:
 - ADDED - alert border colours are auto-generated using `hsl(from var(--crm-alert-background-X) h s calc(l - Y))`
 - ADDED - notification icon colours are auto-generated using `hsl(from var(--crm-c-X) h s calc(l + Y))`
 - ADDED auto primary/secondary hover darken cols via HSL.
 - CHANGED - 'crm-c-alert' to 'crm-c-danger' (https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/32409)
 - CHANGED - Walbrook info alert made consistent with other stream and emphasis alerts (no more inverse bg colour)
 - CHANGED - names of alert emphasis variables made consistent with other names (help becomes 'success', background becomes bg, and the variable targe goes at the end not middle)
 - CHANGED - made heading bg colours match info colour scheme to simplify dark-mode flip.
 - CHANGED - variable for danger/red/cancel colours to --crm-c-danger-on-page-bg, for better dark-mode contrast.
 - CHANGED - variable for form 'required' marker from --crm-c-danger to --crm-notify-danger for a brighter red shade in light and dark mode.
 - REMOVED - many literal colours from core CSS (ie green/red/etc), particularly Bootstrap, swapping to pairs that should maintain contrast in dark-mode.
 - REMOVED - most literal colour names in dark modes that inverse, ie light green becomes dark. Instead emphasis variable points to a different colour (Bg cols still inverse, plus some blues).
 - FIXED - colour contrast issue for `text-X` in dark-mode on all streams.
 - FIXED - extension manager even row / enabled extension hover was grey, now is darker green
 - FIXED - icons on extensions page to notify icon colours to stand out more…
 - FIXED - contrast ratio of AAA added to multiple emphasis colour/text interactions - many were AA or worse (e.g. Minetta Warning/amber, Walbrook blue/primary/info, success, danger).
 - ADDED CSS VARIABLES
    --crm-c-info-light - lighter shade of info colour from --crm-alert-info-bg
    --crm-c-info-on-page-bg - new value for 'text-info'
    --crm-c-warning-light - lighter shade of warning from --crm-alert-warning-bg

 - ADDED Drupal 7 Garland support

0.9.0 - 0.9.40

(Works on 5.75+ only as it uses Angular css overwrites added in https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/30397 to replace the css for Search Kit, Form Builder and some other files, so that CSS variables can be applied to them, fewer '!important' tags used and file size is shurnk).

0.8

Front-end layouts. Adds front-end support for each stream.  Adds CiviCRM logo for front-end pages as inline SVG. Adds CSS Variables for front end with --crm-f prefix, including to choose between inline and stacked label/inputs, to create a focus background, to limit the form width and adjust the logo size.Some fixes. NB v0.8 will be the last major version of RiverLea to work on CiviCRM < 5.75, due to file structure changes enabled by that release. Small fixes can be added as v0.8.1, v0.8.2, etc. NEW VARIBLES

0.7

Dark-mode. Improves dark-mode across all three streams. Improves Hackney Brook. More responsive tables. Many small fixes. Thanks SarahFG, Rich Lott & Guillaume Sorel. NEW VARIBLES

0.6

Adds third stream (Finsbury Park / Hackney Brook). Adds basic dark-mode support. Adds new stream: Hackney Brook, based on Finsbury Park (~90% port). Adds new CSS variables to all streams to support Finsbury Park's two main differences to Shoreditch and Greenwich: button icon styling (unique colours, background, border), and contact dashboard side tabs with active/hover border, similar to the 5.72 SearchKit UI, as well as some extra useful variables (e.g. dialog header border, notification border radius, etc). NEW VARIBLES

0.5

Extensive UI and accessibility fixes following testing in CiviCamp Hamburg - with many thanks to Guillaume Sorel, Thomas Renner, Rositza Dikova, Luciano Spiegel & Peter Reck and the organisers - as well as Rich Lott and the Core Team. Instances of #crm-container removed or replaced with .crm-container which changes some cascade order. Preparation for overwriting other core CiviCRM CSS files from v0.6 which will require CiviCRM 5.75. Version compatibility raised to 5.72 from 5.69 because of Search Kit Builder interface changes: if that interface isn't used then compatibility before 5.69 should be fine.

0.4

CSS files restructure into /core/css and /streams/[stream-name]/css/ with stream variables defined in [stream-name]/css/_variables.css. Variables files are version-numbered - 0.4 with this version. Version numbers should only increase when the CSS Variables in these files change name, are removed or added.

0.3

Two streams, 6 CMS setups tested: Backdrop, Drupal7 + Seven, Drupal9 + Claro/Seven, Joomla 4, Standalone, WordPress. Loads with two theme variations/streams: Minetta and Walbrook. Does not cover: front-end layouts, < 1000px screens, Joomla 3, other Drupal admin themes, light/dark modes.

0.2

Establishes structure, adds a bunch of css variables for testing/dev, adds the entirity of the current Greenwich Bootstrap 3 build to start cutting it back, and adds a components directory with initial component 'accordions' (with animated exapnd/close + CSS variables). Separate components files will likely be merged when the extension is moving to testing, to reduce http requests.

0.1

Proof-of-concept, Brunswick, empty theme structure doing just two things: for older CMS interfaces enforces a 100% font-size default to cascade the browser default font-size, and demonstrates a 1rem variable on top of that for some Civi body text sizes. The computed font-size of Civi paragraph and table text should show as 16px in Inspector (for standard setups).
