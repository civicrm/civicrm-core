# Event Cart Extension

This extracts most of the event cart functionality into an extension.

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Remaining work

1. Migrate sql schema to the extension.
2. Make extension un-hidden & optional.
3. Remove the setting `enable_cart` in favor of enabling/disabling the extension.
