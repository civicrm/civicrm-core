 * Which directories should we exclude when scanning the codebase for things

 * to be a valid preg_match() pattern.
 *
 * If you do not define it, a pattern that excludes dirs starting with a dot is
 * used, e.g. to exclude .git/). Adding suitable patterns here can vastly speed
 * up your container rebuilds and cache flushes. The pattern is matched against
 * the absolute path. Remember to use your system's DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR the
 * examples below assume /
 *
 * The default excludes node_modules (can be huge), various CiviCRM dirs that
 * are unlikely to have anything we need to scan inside, and (what could be
 * your) Drupal's private file storage area. It does not exclude
 * vendor but you are likely to see an improvement by adding it.
 *
 * See https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/setup/optimizations/#exclude-dirs-that-do-not-need-to-be-scanned
 * and also discussion on including vendor (excluded) in https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/issues/2031
