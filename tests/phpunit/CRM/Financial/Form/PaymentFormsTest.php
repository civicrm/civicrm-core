/**
 *  Test various payment forms.
 *
 * This class is intended to be a place to build out testing of various forms - with the
 * hope being to ensure all payment forms are consistently tested and to refine
 * helper functions into a trait that could be available to
 * extensions for testing - notably the eventcart which ideally should interact with core
 * through approved interfaces - ideally even in tests.
 *
 * An approved interface would sit in the Civi directory and would at minimum support some functions
 * to support using our processors in tests so we are testing a broader swath than just Dummy.
 * Currently Authorize.net is also testable (uses Guzzle). At some point PaypalPro & Std should also be testable
 * - allowing us to easily check payment forms work with the core processors which cover a reasonable amount of the
 * expectations held by non-core processors .
 *
 * Note that this tests eventcart but is not in eventcart because I want to be sure about whether the
 * traits supporting it make sense before making them available to extensions.
