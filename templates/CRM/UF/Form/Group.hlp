{capture assign="miscURL"}{crmURL p="civicrm/admin/setting/misc" q="reset=1"}{/capture}
<p>{ts}When reCAPTCHA is enabled for a profile form, anonymous users are required to read an image with letters and numbers and enter the value in a field. This helps prevent abuse by automated scripts.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts 1="https://www.google.com/recaptcha" 2=$miscURL}To use reCAPTCHA you must sign up at <a href="%1" target="_blank">Google's reCaptcha site</a> to get your public and private keys. Then enter both keys in <a href="%2">Administer CiviCRM &raquo; System Settings &raquo; Misc (Undelete, PDFs, Limits, Logging, Captcha, etc.)</a>.{/ts}</p>
<p><strong>{ts}Do not enable this feature if you are using this profile as an HTML Form Snippet embedded in a non-CiviCRM web page. reCAPTCHA requires dynamic page generation. Submitting a stand-alone form with reCAPTCHA included will always result in a reCAPTCHA validation error.{/ts}</strong></p>

  {ts}Account Creation{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-is_cms_user'}
{ts 1=`$config->userFramework`}If you are using this profile as a contact signup form, using it in an online contribution page OR an event registration page, anonymous users will be given the option to create a %1 User Account as part of completing the form.{/ts}
{if $config->userSystem->is_drupal EQ '1'}
    {ts}This feature requires your Drupal User Settings to allow 'vistors to create accounts' (with or without administrator approval). The 'Email Verification' option may be enabled or disabled.{/ts}
    {ts}If the 'Email Verification' option is enabled, users will receive a welcome email from Drupal with login information. Otherwise they will select a Password inline, and if administrator approval is not required they will be automatically logged in as soon as the transaction is completed.{/ts}
{elseif $config->userFramework EQ 'Joomla'}
    {ts}This feature requires the 'Allow User Registration' setting to be 'Yes' in Joomla Global Configuration >> System Settings.{/ts}
{/if}
 {ts}In addition, you must include a Primary Email Address field in the profile.{/ts}
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-is_update_dupe-title'}
  {ts}Duplicate Matching{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-is_update_dupe'}
  <p>{ts}If you are using the profile as a contact signup and editing form - this option controls what happens if the data matches an existing contact record. Using this option user can update the matching record or create a duplicate record or otherwise he will get a 'duplicate record' warning, and their input will not be saved. Contact matching is based on your configured 'Strict' rule for identifying duplicate contacts.{/ts} {docURL page="user/common-workflows/deduping-and-merging"}</p>
  <p>{ts}This setting is ignored if the profile is embedded in an online contribution, membership signup or event registration form. In this case a contact match always results in the transaction being linked to the matching contact.</p>{/ts}
  <p>{ts}In all cases, the check for an existing matching contact uses the default "Individual Strict Duplicate Matching Rule" (match on email address). If you are concerned with existing contact data being over-written by anonymous visitors, you can modify this rule to make matches less likely (or even impossible). For example, if you NEVER want anonymous input to match (i.e. always create a new contact record) - edit that rule and set the 'weight threshold' higher than 10. You will then need to run Find Duplicates periodically using a different rule, and merge any duplicate records with their associated memberships, contributions, etc.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}NOTE: If there are multiple matching contacts, the first matching record is used.{/ts}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-is_map-title'}
  {ts}Map Link{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-is_map'}
  {ts}If enabled, a Map link is included on the profile listings rows and detail screens for any contacts whose records include sufficient location data for your mapping provider.{/ts}
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-is_edit_link-title'}
  {ts}Edit Link{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-is_edit_link'}
  {ts}Check this box if you want to include a link in the listings to Edit profile fields. Only users with permission to edit the contact will see this link.{/ts}
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-is_uf_link-title'}
  {ts}User Link{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-is_uf_link'}
  {ts 1=`$config->userFramework`}Check this box if you want to include a link in the listings to view contacts' %1 user account information (e.g. their 'My Account' page). This link will only be included for contacts who have a user account on your website.{/ts}
{/htxt}

{htxt id='id-is_proximity_search-title'}
  {ts}Proximity Search{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-is_proximity_search'}
<p>
  {ts}If you are using this profile as a search form, you can choose to include proximity searching. When enabled, a proximity search block will be added to the search criteria. This block will contain fields to set the proximity start address, and a field to set a 'Radius' (distance from that address).{/ts}
</p>
<p>
  {ts}Set Proximity Search as required if you want all searches using this profile to require the user to enter a start address and a radius.{/ts}
</p>
<p>
  {ts}IMPORTANT: You must enable a Mapping Provider in order to use the Proximity Search feature (Administer > System Settings > Mapping and Geocoding).{/ts}
