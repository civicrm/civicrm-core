  {ts}Import File Format{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="upload"}
<p>
    {ts}Files to be imported must be in the 'comma-separated-values' format (CSV). Most applications will allow you to export records in CSV format. Consult the documentation for your application if you're not sure how to do this.{/ts}
</p>
<h1>{ts}Contact Records for Members{/ts}</h1>
<p>
    {ts}Membership import requires that each person, household or organization already exists as a contact record in your CiviCRM database. If you need to import memberships for contact records which haven't been added to CiviCRM yet - you will do this in 2 steps. First, use <strong>Import Contacts</strong> to add the contact records. If possible, include a unique 'External ID' for each new contact which you can then use to match memberships to contacts. Then return to this screen and import the membership records.{/ts}
</p>
<h1>{ts}Matching Memberships to Contacts{/ts}</h1>
<p>{ts}Membership import files must contain data needed to <strong>match the membership to the contact record</strong>. This 'matching' can be handled in several different ways:{/ts}</p>
    <ul>
    <li>{ts}Include the data fields used for contact 'matching' based on your configured <strong>Unsupervised Duplicate Matching</strong> rules. For the default duplicate matching rules, you would include a column in each row with the contributors' Email Address.{/ts}</li>
    <li>{ts}If you've stored a unique <strong>External Identifier</strong> for each contact in CiviCRM, you can include that value as a column in your import file. Memberships will then be matched to contact records using their External ID.{/ts}</li>
    <li>{ts}You can include a column with each contact's <strong>Internal Contact ID</strong>. This is the unique ID assigned by CiviCRM which is displayed at the bottom of the Contact Summary screen - and can be exported.{/ts}</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    {ts}Save the CSV file with your membership data and 'contact matching' data to your local hard drive (or an accessible drive on your network) - and you are now ready for step 1 (Upload Data).{/ts}
</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id="id-onDuplicate-title"}
  {ts}Matching to Contacts for Inserts and Updates{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-onDuplicate"}
    <p>{ts}For each import, you can either INSERT new membership records, or UPDATE existing records. You can not do both types of operations in a single import session.{/ts}</p>
    <p>{ts}If you are INSERTING new membership records, you will need to include a column in your data file containing the values used to link the membership to an existing contact. You can use the 'Internal Contact ID', an 'External Identifier' (if you are using those in your contact records), OR the property defined in your Unsupervised Duplicate Matching rule (which is Email Address by default).{/ts}</p>
    <p>{ts}If you are UPDATING existing memberships, you will need to include a column containing the unique CiviCRM-assigned membership ID to match to the existing membership records.{/ts}</p>
