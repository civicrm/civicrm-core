{htxt id="id-status-override"}
  <p>{ts}Membership status is normally assigned and updated automatically based on your configured membership status rules. However, if you want to assign a status manually and bypass automated status setting, choose either "Override Permanently" or "Override Until Selected Date", Then you can select from the available status options.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}If you select "Override Permanently", The status you assign will remain in force, unless it is again modified on this screen. If you select "Override Until Selected Date", it will behave same as "Override Permanently" but will revert to "No" once the selected date is reached. As long as the Membership Override is active, the automated membership status update script will NOT update this membership record.{/ts}</p>

{htxt id="id-contribution_contact"}
  <p>{ts}Check this box if someone other than the member is paying for this membership (i.e. a gift membership or gift subscription), and you want to link the payment to the person who is actually paying.  You will be able to select an existing contact or enter a new one. The resulting contribution record will be linked to the payer, and a soft credit for that contribution will be linked to this contact (the member).{/ts}</p>

  {ts}Override End Date for Auto-renew Memberships{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="override_end_date"}
  <p>{ts}If CiviCRM's membership end-date is different from when the payment processor will next collect a payment, various problems can occur. Members may experience a gap in their membership, and the renewal date may get changed from what is manually entered. Use care when modifying the End Date value, and check the associated recurring payment in your payment processor system so they always match.{/ts}</p>
