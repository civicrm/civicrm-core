  <p>
    {ts}Assign a unique name to each of your mailings. Select a naming convention that will help keep your mailings organized and easy to find when you want to review and compare mailing results. For example, if you do a monthly general-interest newsletter - you might use the following naming convention:{/ts}
  </p><p>
  <strong>{ts}General Monthly Newsletter: 200709{/ts}</strong>
</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id ="from_email"}

{htxt id="html"}
  <p>{ts}You can choose to send BOTH an <strong>HTML</strong> and a plain <strong>TEXT</strong> version of your mailing, OR you can send a <strong>TEXT</strong> version only.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}If you create only an <strong>HTML</strong> version, CiviMail will automatically create a <strong>TEXT</strong> version for your recipients who have chosen NOT to receive HTML email.{/ts}</p>
  <h1>{ts}Required Elements{/ts}</h1>
  <p>{ts}CiviMail email messages must include an <strong>opt-out</strong> link ("Opt out via web page"), and the <strong>postal address</strong> of your organization. These elements help reduce the chances of your email being categorized as SPAM. They can be included in the main message body OR in a re-usable <strong>message footer</strong>. Refer to the online documentation for details on how to include required links and contact information as well as sample messages.{/ts} {docURL page="Sample CiviMail Messages" resource="wiki"}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id="text"}
  <p>{ts}You can send your email as a simple text-only message, as an HTML formatted message, or both. Text-only messages are sufficient for most email communication - and some recipients may prefer not to receive HTML formatted messages.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}HTML messages have more visual impact, allow you to include images, and may be more readable if you are including links to website pages. However, different email programs may interpret HTML formats differently - so use this option cautiously unless you have a template format that has been tested with different web and desktop email programs.{/ts}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id="header"}

{/htxt}

{htxt id="footer"}

{htxt id="dedupe_email"}
  <p>{ts}Multiple people -- such as spouses, parents, or children -- may sometimes share the same email address.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}To send only one message to the shared address, enable this option. Mail-merge tokens will be filled for only one person.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}To send separate messages for each person, disable this option. Mail-merge tokens will be filled separately for each person.{/ts}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id="visibility"}
  <p>
    {ts}This option controls who can view the contents of this email on your website. The link can be included by inserting the "Mailing permalink" token (place it in a link when composing in HTML mode).{/ts}
