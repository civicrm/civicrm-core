<p>{ts}Personal Campaign Pages (PCPs) allow your constituents to create their own fundraising page for your organization. This means that a donor, after donating to your organization, can elect to create a page with her own photo, text, and personal information. She can then send a link to the page to her friends, soliciting support for your organization. This is a powerful way to widely and quickly spread the message about your campaign.{/ts}</p>

<p>{ts}When someone donates through a personal campaign page, a soft credit is given to the owner of the page to recognize the role she played in the contribution. CiviContribute has a section that allows you to administer all of the PCPs for your organization. You can require approval before a PCP goes 'live', and disable or delete any campaign pages you don't approve of.{/ts} {docURL page="user/contributions/personal-campaign-pages"}</p>
