<p>{ts}Select the HTML WYSIWYG Editor provided for fields that allow HTML formatting. Select 'Textarea' if you don't want to provide a WYSIWYG Editor (users will type text and / or HTML code into plain text fields).{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}<strong>Spell-checking:</strong> ckEditor includes a Spell-check button by default. There is also an optional plugin which does spell-checking automatically (as you type). However, this plugin is not enabled by default since it sends user input to a 3rd party service (spellchecker.net) without informing the user - and this may pose privacy issues for some sites.{/ts}
<p>{ts}To enable auto spell check, in packages/ckeditor/config.js - change this value to true:{/ts}<br />
config.scayt_autoStartup = false;
<p>{ts}To remove the Spell Check button, in packages/ckeditor/config.js - remove this item in the config.toolbar_Full list:{/ts}<br />
'SpellChecker'
<p>{ts}<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are modifying config.js you should first have configured a Custom PHP Path under Administer > System Settings > Directories, and place your modified version in the custom path.{/ts}</p>
