    <em>{ts}Employee <-> Employer and Household relationships both have special characteristics.{/ts}</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    {ts}<strong>Employee <-> Employer relationship</strong> is created anytime the 'Current Employer' field is filled in, either in the Contact Summary form or via a Profile. When filled in, it will create an Organisation if one does not already exist with that name.{/ts}
  </p>
  <p>
    {ts}<strong>Household relationship</strong> enables household members to have the 'household address' applied to their record. Again, if a Household already exists then the individual will have a relationship created with it, if none exists then a new household will be created.{/ts}
  </p>
