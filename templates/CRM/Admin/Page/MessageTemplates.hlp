{htxt id="id-intro"}
<p>
  {ts}Templates allow you to save and re-use messages with layouts. You can use them when sending email or letters to one or more contacts. If you are using CiviMail for enewsletters, newsletter templates take care of the layout so authors can focus on content.</p>{/ts}
<p>
  {ts}You may include tokens to represent fields (like a contact's "first name") in the message subject and body. These will be replaced with the actual value of the corresponding field in the outgoing message. Click "Insert Tokens" for a searchable list of available tokens.{/ts} {$tokenDocLink}
</p>
<p>
  {ts 1=$schedRemURL}Messages used for membership renewal reminders, as well as event and activity related reminders generally use tokens specific to membership, participant or activity records. For example, a membership renewal reminder may include the membership type and end date tokens. The <a href="%1">Scheduled Reminders</a> screen includes these tokens in the "Insert Tokens" tool, so it is best to create reminder templates there.{/ts} {$schedRemindersDocLink}

  {ts}System Workflow Message Templates{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-system-workflow"}
<p>
  {ts}System workflow message templates are used to generate the emails sent to consituents and administrators for contribution receipts, event confirmations and many other workflows. You can customize the style and wording of these messages here.{/ts}
</p>
<p>
  {ts}Workflow messages include text AND necessary program logic. Use caution when editing so as not to modify the program logic. Be sure to test the workflow and review the emails sent after making any changes. If you find that your changes have caused problems, errors or missing information - you can always &quot;Revert&quot; to the system default for that workflow.{/ts}
</p>
<p>
  {ts}If your organization has modified the default versions of System Workflow message templates, then the changes and bug fixes included in an upgrade will need to be merged with your modified versions.{/ts} {$upgradeTemplatesDocLink}

  {ts}You can view or revert to the default version of any system workflow message template which you've modified. After upgrades OR if you are having issues with your modified version, it is useful to compare your active version to the default code shown on this screen. You can use the 'Select' buttons below (with copy and paste commands) to copy the default code into a text editor and then compare it to your customized version.{/ts}
