<p>{ts}Use the form below to configure a Widget Title (with optional logo), your contribute button text, a short description of this fund-raising campaign, and a link to your organizations home page (for folks who want to learn more). You can also modify the default color-scheme by expanding the 'Edit Widget Colors' section of the form.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}Check the 'Enable Widget' box. Then review and modify the form values as needed. Save your settings and preview the current appearance of the widget by clicking the 'Save and Preview' button. Then 'Select' and copy the 'Widget Code' into any web page.{/ts}</p>
