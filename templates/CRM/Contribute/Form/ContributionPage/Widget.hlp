<p>{ts}Enabling a widget for this contribution page allows you and your supporters to easily promote a fund-raising campaign by embedding a chunk of dynamic content in any web page. CiviContribute widgets display real-time progress toward your fund-raising goals, and include a 'Contribute' button which links people directly to the associated online contribution page.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}Use the form below to configure a Widget Title (with optional logo), your contribute button text, a short description of this fund-raising campaign, and a link to your organizations home page (for folks who want to learn more). You can also modify the default color-scheme by expanding the 'Edit Widget Colors' section of the form.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}Check the 'Enable Widget' box. Then review and modify the form values as needed. Save your settings and preview the current appearance of the widget by clicking the 'Save and Preview' button. Then 'Select' and copy the 'Widget Code' into any web page.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}If this campaign has specific start and end dates, embedded widgets will display the link to your Home Page instead of the Contribute button once the campaign is over.{/ts}</p>
