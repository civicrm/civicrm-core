{htxt id="manage_groups"}
    <p>{ts}Use Groups to organize contacts (e.g. these contacts are part of our 'Steering Committee'). You can also create <strong>smart groups</strong> based on contact characteristics (e.g. this group consists of all people in our database who live in a specific locality).{/ts} {docURL page="user/organising-your-data/groups-and-tags"}</p>
    <p>{ts}You can add contacts to a group from any set of search results (or when viewing an individual contact). You can also allow contacts to sign themselves up for certain groups by setting the group visibility to 'Public Pages' (use the <strong>Settings</strong> link), and including the <strong>Groups</strong> element in your CiviCRM Profile.{/ts} {docURL page="user/the-user-interface/profiles"}</p>
    <p>{ts}Groups which are used as mailing lists should be assigned the 'Mailing List' type.{/ts} {if $config->userFramework neq 'Joomla'}{ts}Groups of contacts which are used for <strong>access control</strong> must be assigned that type.{/ts} {docURL page="user/initial-set-up/access-control"}{/if}</p>
    <p>{ts}Use <strong>Find Groups</strong> to search by group name, type and visibility.{/ts}{if $config->userFramework neq 'Joomla'} {ts}Group type filtering uses <strong>AND</strong> logic. If you check both 'Mailing List' and 'Access Control' types - only groups which have both types assigned will be returned.{/ts}{/if} {ts}You can also click a letter on the <strong>A-to-Z bar</strong> to quickly find all groups starting with that letter.{/ts}</p>

{htxt id="id-group-visibility"}
<p>{ts}Select 'User and User Admin Only' if joining this group is controlled by authorized CiviCRM users only. If you want to allow contacts to join and remove themselves from this group via the Registration and Account Profile forms, select 'Public Pages'.{/ts}</p>

  {ts}Group Nesting{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-group-parent"}
<p>{ts}Some organizations find it useful to create a hierarchy of groups. In CiviCRM, this is done by creating one or more "Parent" groups and then assigning other groups to them. When a user sends a mailing to a "Parent", or searches for contacts in a "Parent" - all contacts in the associated child groups are automatically included.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}EXAMPLE: An organization that has a National office and 5 regional offices puts constituents in each region into their own group. Then they create a "National" group which is assigned as the "Parent" for all regional groups. The National office can now send mailings (for example) to the "National" group - knowing that all contacts in the regional groups will be included.{/ts}</p>

{htxt id="id-group-organization-title"}
  {ts}Group Organization{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-group-organization"}
<p>{ts}Some organizations find it useful to be able to connect Organization contacts to Groups (one-to-one relationship) to represent a multi-org hierarchy. The org contact holds info about the org itself (name, location, etc.) and the group holds other sub-groups/contacts related to that group (employees, alumni, online activists, members, etc.).{/ts}</p>
