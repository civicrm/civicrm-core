  {ts}Contact Type{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='contact-type'}
  <p>{ts}Select <strong>Individual</strong> for Contact Type if each record in your file represents an individual person - even if the file also contains related Organization data (e.g. Employer Name, Employer Address, etc.).{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}Select <strong>Organization</strong> or <strong>Household</strong> if each record in your file represents a contact of that type.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}<strong>Importing Contact Subtypes</strong> - If your file contains a mix of "subtypes" belonging to a built-in type, select the built-in ("parent") type here. You will then be able to map a Contact Subtype field from your file which sets the subtype for each row. EXAMPLE: If you are importing a mixture of Individuals who are "Students" and "Parents" and "Staff" subtypes, select "Individual" here AND include a column in your import file which contains the subtype for each row.{/ts}</p>
  <p>{ts}If all records in the file belong to the same subtype, then select that subtype from the "Subtype" field. All records will be automatically assigned to that subtype. In this case you do NOT need to include a Subtype column in the file.{/ts}</p>

{/htxt}
{htxt id='contact-sub-type'}
<p>{ts}Select a specific Contact Subtype here ONLY if all you want all records in this import to be assigned to that subtype. EXAMPLE: If all records are of the <strong>Student</strong>, select that subtype here and it will be assigned to all import records.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}Do NOT select a Contact Subtype if your import file contains a mixture of subtypes. In that case, select the built-in ("parent") type, and make sure you'll file includes include a column which sets the subtype for each row.{/ts}</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      {ts}<strong>Skip:</strong> Reports and then Skips duplicate import file rows - leaving the matching record in the database as-is (default).{/ts}
    </li>
    <li>
      {ts}<strong>Update:</strong> Updates database fields with available import data. Fields in the database which are NOT included in the import row are left as-is.{/ts}
    </li>
    <li>
      {ts}<strong>Fill:</strong> Fills in additional contact data only. Database fields which currently have values are left as-is.{/ts}

      <tr><td>{ts}A spreadsheet-like file with the contact data in each row. Data fields are separated by commas. You can export to a "CSV" file from most spreadsheet applications, many database managers, as well as other contact management and address book applications. Consult the documentation for your application if you're not sure how to do this. Save this file to your local hard drive (or an accessible drive on your network) - and then choose that file as your Import Upload File.{/ts}</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>{ts}SQL Query{/ts}</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>{ts}A direct SQL query in the form of a SELECT query. For example:{/ts}</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM somedatabase.sometable</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td>{ts}This query can be against a different database, but that database has to be on the same database server and the CiviCRM database user has to have the SELECT privilege (and any other privileges required to execute the query).{/ts}</td></tr>

  {ts}Dedupe Rule{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-dedupe_rule'}
  {ts}If you have selected one of the dedupe options besides "no duplicate checking," CiviCRM will use a predefined dedupe rule to determine possible matches for your imported records. Existing dedupe rules may be reviewed, and new rules created, by visiting Contacts > Find and Merge Duplicate Contacts.{/ts}
  {ts}When selecting a dedupe rule, be sure to choose one that includes fields contained in your import file. Also be aware that the update and fill options could have significant impact on your existing data. You should define and select a rule that is strict enough to ensure there are no false positive matches.{/ts}

{/htxt}
{htxt id='id-fieldSeparator'}

Common values include a comma, semicolon, or pipe character. To import a tab separated file, enter "tab" (without quotes) in the field.{/ts}
