{if $params.logged_in_email_setting == "1"}
  <p>{ts}By default, CiviCRM uses the primary email address of the logged in user as the FROM address when sending emails to contacts. However, users with Administer CiviCRM permission can configure one or more general email addresses that can be selected as an alternative. EXAMPLE: "Client Services" &lt;clientservices@example.org&gt;{/ts}</p>
{else}
  <p>{ts}CiviCRM is currently configured to only use the defined From Email addresses. If you wish to be able to use the email address of the logged in user as the From Address you will need to set the setting "Allow mail from loged in contact" setting. Users with Administer CiviCRM can set this setting in the SMTP settings.{/ts}<p>
  {if $params.isAdmin}
    {capture assign="smtpUrl"}{crmURL p="civicrm/admin/setting/smtp" q="reset=1"}{/capture}
    <p>{ts 1=$smtpUrl}Go to <a href='%1'>Settings - Outbound Mail</a> to enable the usage of the logged in contact's email address as the from email{/ts}</p>

{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-token-subject"}
<p>{ts}Use a token in the Subject when you are sending mail to a number of recipients and want to include their name and / or other values from their contact record automatically in the subject line.{/ts}</p>
{/htxt}

{htxt id="id-token-text-title"}
  {ts}Tokens{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-token-text"}
<p>{ts}Use tokens when you are sending mail to a number of recipients, and want to include their name and / or other values from their contact record automatically within your message.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts 1='&#123;contact.first_name&#125;'}EXAMPLE: If you want your message to begin with "Dear " followed by the recipient's first name, you can use the %1 token in your message. <em>Dear %1</em>{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}Place your cursor within the Message box where you want to the token to be inserted. Then click the &quot;Insert Tokens&quot; link in the upper right corner of the message box to see a list of available tokens.

    </p>
{/if}
<p>{ts}Custom tokens (based on custom data) can be added for organizations as well. These tokens will not be displayed in the list of available tokens, but can be added manually. The format is {literal}{contact.custom_12}{/literal} – where 12 is the ID of the custom data field. To find the custom data field ID,
go Administer > Customize Data & Screens > Custom Fields and click ‘edit’ on the field you want to use. Look at the URL. The last part of the URL will
be an equal sign and a number (=12). The number (12 in this example) is the id of that custom field.{/ts}</p>

  {ts}Message Text{/ts}
{/htxt}
{htxt id="id-message-text"}
<p>{ts}You can send your email as a simple text-only message, as an HTML formatted message, or both. Text-only messages are sufficient for most email communication - and some recipients may prefer not to receive HTML formatted messages.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}HTML messages have more visual impact, allow you to include images, and may be more readable if you are including links to website pages. However, different email programs may interpret HTML formats differently - so use this option cautiously unless you have a template format that has been tested with different web and desktop email programs.{/ts}</p>
